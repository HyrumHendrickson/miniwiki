  <p>The <strong>American Civil War</strong> (1861–1865) was the defining crisis of the American republic — a conflict that tested whether a nation founded on the proposition that all men are created equal could endure and live up to that proposition. It claimed more American lives than all other wars in the nation's history combined, and its resolution — the preservation of the Union and the abolition of chattel slavery — vindicated the moral logic of the Declaration of Independence that the Founders had not the courage or the means to fully realize.</p>

  <p>The war's causes were complex but ultimately reducible to one: slavery. The Confederate states seceded explicitly to preserve and extend the institution of slavery, as their own leaders stated plainly in their declarations of secession and their Constitution. The Union fought initially to preserve the republic against rebellion, but the war evolved, through Lincoln's moral and strategic genius, into a second American founding — a "new birth of freedom," as Lincoln called it at Gettysburg.</p>

  <h2>Causes and Sectional Crisis</h2>

  <p>The tensions between the slaveholding South and the free-labor North had been building since the founding. The Missouri Compromise (1820), the Compromise of 1850, the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), and the Dred Scott decision (1857) — each intended to resolve the question of slavery's extension — instead intensified it. The Republican Party, founded in 1854 on opposition to the extension of slavery, was anathema to the South; Abraham Lincoln's election in 1860 on the Republican ticket triggered the secession of South Carolina and, quickly, six more Deep South states.</p>

  <p>The Confederate States of America's Vice President, Alexander Stephens, in his "Cornerstone Speech" (March 1861), was unambiguous: the Confederate government's "foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition." The conflict was about slavery.</p>

  <h2>Abraham Lincoln</h2>

  <p>No figure in American history is more important for understanding the Civil War than Abraham Lincoln. A self-educated lawyer from Illinois with deep roots in the Western frontier and a mind formed by the Bible and Shakespeare, Lincoln entered the presidency without executive experience in the gravest crisis the republic had faced. His greatness lay in his clarity about the moral stakes of the conflict, his patience and political skill in managing a fractious coalition, his willingness to learn and adapt as commander-in-chief, and his extraordinary capacity for language.</p>

  <p>Lincoln understood the war as the unfinished business of the Founding — the fulfillment, at terrible cost, of the Declaration's promise. The Gettysburg Address (November 19, 1863), in 272 words, reinterpreted the war and the nation: "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal." America was not merely a union of states but a nation "dedicated to a proposition" — a moral idea. The war tested whether that idea could survive.</p>

  <blockquote>
    With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.
    <cite>Abraham Lincoln, Second Inaugural Address, March 4, 1865</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Legacy</h2>

  <p>The Civil War settled permanently that the United States was an indivisible nation — not a compact among sovereign states that could dissolve at will — and that slavery was incompatible with the American creed. The Reconstruction Amendments (13th, 14th, 15th) constitutionalized these outcomes, though their full realization would await another century of struggle.</p>

  <p>The war's legacy is complex and contested, but certain things are clear. Lincoln's interpretation — that the war was the necessary fulfillment of the Declaration's promise — is the correct one. The Confederate cause was not merely a defense of states' rights but a defense of human bondage, and its defeat was a moral necessity. The courage and sacrifice of Union soldiers — including 180,000 Black soldiers who fought for their own freedom and the freedom of their people — represents one of the highest expressions of American idealism.</p>
