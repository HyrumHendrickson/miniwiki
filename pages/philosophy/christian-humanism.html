  <p><strong>Christian humanism</strong> is the intellectual and cultural tradition that holds together fidelity to the Christian faith and a high valuation of classical learning, reason, and human dignity. It is neither a naive secularism that forgets God nor a fideism that distrusts reason, but the via media that has animated the greatest achievements of Western civilization: the synthesis of Athens and Jerusalem, of philosophy and theology, of the liberal arts and sacred Scripture.</p>

  <p>Against the claim that faith and reason are fundamentally at odds, the Christian humanist tradition insists that <em>grace perfects nature rather than destroying it</em> (Aquinas). The life of the mind, far from being a distraction from faith, is one of its highest expressions — for to study creation is to contemplate the mind of the Creator.</p>

  <h2>Patristic Foundations</h2>

  <p>The first great Christian humanists were the Church Fathers who encountered Greek philosophy and, rather than rejecting it, baptized what was true in it. Justin Martyr argued that the <em>Logos</em> — the divine Reason identified in John's Gospel with Christ — was at work among the Greek philosophers, so that what they truly knew was a participation in truth that finds its fullness in Christ. Augustine synthesized Platonic philosophy with Christian theology in the <em>Confessions</em> and <em>The City of God</em>. Clement of Alexandria called Greek philosophy "a schoolmaster to bring the Greek mind to Christ."</p>

  <h2>The Renaissance Christian Humanists</h2>

  <p>The Northern Renaissance produced the most concentrated expression of Christian humanism in the work of Desiderius Erasmus and Thomas More. Erasmus — the greatest classical scholar of his age — applied humanist philological methods to the New Testament, producing a corrected Greek edition that fueled the Reformation, while remaining committed to the reform of the Church from within. His <em>Praise of Folly</em> deployed satirical wit in the service of a deeper seriousness about Christian life and learning.</p>

  <p>Thomas More, Lord Chancellor of England under Henry VIII and martyr, exemplified the ideal of the Christian humanist in his person: a scholar of Plato, a friend of Erasmus, a devoted family man, a gifted lawyer, and a man who died rather than betray his conscience. His <em>Utopia</em> explored the limits of natural reason in constructing a just society, showing what philosophy can achieve without the guidance of revelation — and implicitly what it requires.</p>

  <h2>The Liberal Arts Tradition</h2>

  <p>The Christian humanist tradition is inseparable from the <em>artes liberales</em> — the seven liberal arts that formed the curriculum of the medieval university and, before that, of classical education. These divide into the <em>trivium</em> (grammar, rhetoric, logic) and the <em>quadrivium</em> (arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy). The liberal arts are called "liberal" not because they lack rigor but because they are proper to free men — they cultivate the soul rather than train it for servile tasks.</p>

  <p>This vision of education as formation of the whole person — intellectual, moral, and spiritual — is the perennial alternative to the utilitarian model that reduces education to job training. The Christian humanist holds that a person who has read Homer and Virgil, studied geometry and music, learned to argue clearly and write well, and reflected on the great questions of existence is better equipped for any vocation — including the vocation of citizen — than one who has been narrowly trained for a single function.</p>

  <h2>Newman and the Idea of a University</h2>

  <p>Cardinal John Henry Newman's <em>The Idea of a University</em> (1852) is the most sustained and eloquent defense of the liberal arts tradition in the English language. Newman argued that the purpose of a university is to train the intellect — to form in students a habit of mind that is broad, flexible, disciplined, and capable of relating knowledge from one field to another. This is what he called "liberal knowledge," and he insisted that it has intrinsic worth regardless of its practical applications.</p>

  <blockquote>
    The intellect, which has been disciplined to the perfection of its powers, which knows and thinks while it knows, which has learned to leaven the dense mass of facts and events with the elastic force of reason, such an intellect cannot be partial, cannot be exclusive, cannot be impetuous, cannot be at a loss.
    <cite>John Henry Newman, <em>The Idea of a University</em></cite>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>C. S. Lewis and the Defense of Western Learning</h2>

  <p>In the twentieth century, C. S. Lewis became perhaps the most widely read Christian humanist apologist. His <em>The Abolition of Man</em> (1943) defended the classical and Christian tradition of objective moral value — what he called the <em>Tao</em>, "the doctrine of objective value, the belief that certain attitudes are really true, and others really false, to the kind of thing the universe is and the kind of things we are" — against the subjectivism and reductionism of modern educational philosophy. Lewis saw clearly that to undermine the tradition of natural law and objective value was ultimately to destroy the very humanity of man.</p>

  <h2>Christian Humanism and Latter-day Saint Thought</h2>

  <p>The Latter-day Saint tradition has a native affinity with Christian humanism. The thirteenth Article of Faith declares: "If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things." The Doctrine and Covenants commands: "Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;C 88:118). These injunctions reflect the classical humanist conviction that all truth is God's truth, that learning is a religious duty, and that the life of the mind is not merely compatible with faith but required by it.</p>
