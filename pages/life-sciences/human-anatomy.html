  <p>Human anatomy is the science of the structure of the human body — the arrangement and organization of its cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems and the relationships among them. It is one of the oldest branches of medicine and science, rooted in the direct examination of the human body through dissection, and it remains fundamental to medical education and practice. Understanding anatomy is the prerequisite for understanding physiology (how the body functions), pathology (how disease alters structure and function), and clinical medicine (how to diagnose and treat illness).</p>

  <p>Gross (macroscopic) anatomy studies structures visible to the naked eye, while microscopic anatomy (histology) examines tissues and cells under the microscope, and developmental anatomy traces how structures arise and change through embryogenesis and postnatal development. The human body is organized hierarchically: cells of similar type aggregate into tissues (epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous tissue); tissues combine to form organs; organs work together in organ systems; and the organ systems together constitute the complete organism. The body contains approximately 37 trillion cells, 78 recognized organs, and eleven major organ systems, all exquisitely coordinated through nervous and endocrine signaling to maintain homeostasis — the stable internal environment essential for life.</p>

  <h2>The Skeletal and Muscular Systems</h2>

  <p>The skeletal system provides the body's structural framework, protects vital organs, serves as a lever system for movement, produces blood cells (in the red marrow of certain bones), and stores calcium and phosphorus. The adult human skeleton comprises 206 named bones, organized into the axial skeleton (skull, vertebral column, and rib cage) and the appendicular skeleton (shoulder and pelvic girdles and the limbs). Bones are living organs containing both compact bone (dense outer layer providing strength) and spongy (cancellous) bone (a lighter, lattice-like interior that houses red marrow). Joints — the articulations between bones — are classified by their degree of movement: synarthroses (immovable, such as the sutures of the skull), amphiarthroses (slightly movable, such as the intervertebral discs), and diarthroses (freely movable synovial joints, such as the knee, hip, and shoulder).</p>

  <p>The muscular system consists of approximately 640 named muscles that generate movement, maintain posture, and produce heat. Three types of muscle tissue are distinguished: skeletal muscle, which is striated and under voluntary control, attaches to bones via tendons and produces the movements of the body; cardiac muscle, which is also striated but involuntary, forms the walls of the heart and generates the rhythmic contractions of the heartbeat; and smooth muscle, which is non-striated and involuntary, lines the walls of internal organs (stomach, intestines, bladder, blood vessels) and controls their functions. Skeletal muscle contraction is driven by the sliding filament mechanism, in which actin and myosin filaments within the sarcomere slide past each other powered by ATP hydrolysis, shortening the muscle. The nervous system and motor end plates coordinate the recruitment of motor units to produce precise, graded movements.</p>

  <h2>The Nervous System</h2>

  <p>The nervous system is the body's principal communication and control network, enabling perception of the environment, integration of information, and coordination of responses. It is divided into the central nervous system (CNS) — the brain and spinal cord — and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) — all nervous tissue outside the CNS, including the cranial nerves, spinal nerves, and their associated ganglia. The fundamental cell type is the neuron, which transmits electrical signals (action potentials) along its axon and communicates with other neurons and effector cells via chemical signals (neurotransmitters) across synapses. The human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons and an even greater number of glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and Schwann cells) that support, nourish, and maintain the neurons.</p>

  <p>The brain is divided into the cerebrum (divided into two hemispheres and containing the cerebral cortex responsible for higher cognitive functions), the cerebellum (coordination of movement and balance), and the brainstem (medulla oblongata, pons, and midbrain — controlling vital automatic functions including breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure). The spinal cord serves as both a relay pathway between the brain and the body and a site of reflex arcs that allow rapid responses to stimuli without involving the brain. The peripheral nervous system is further divided into the somatic nervous system (voluntary control of skeletal muscles and sensory input) and the autonomic nervous system (involuntary regulation of internal organs, further subdivided into sympathetic — "fight or flight" — and parasympathetic — "rest and digest" — divisions).</p>

  <h2>The Circulatory and Respiratory Systems</h2>

  <p>The circulatory (cardiovascular) system is responsible for transporting oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and metabolic waste products throughout the body. The heart — a muscular pump roughly the size of a fist, located slightly left of center in the thorax — drives two circuits: the pulmonary circulation (right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation) and the systemic circulation (left side pumps oxygenated blood to the rest of the body). Blood flows through three types of vessels: arteries (which carry blood away from the heart and have thick, elastic walls to withstand high pressure), capillaries (microscopic vessels with walls one cell thick, where exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste occurs between blood and tissues), and veins (which return blood to the heart and contain valves to prevent backflow). William Harvey's demonstration in 1628 that blood circulates continuously around the body — a revelation that overturned Galenic medicine — was one of the most important advances in the history of medicine.</p>

  <p>The respiratory system provides oxygen to the body and removes carbon dioxide, the waste product of cellular metabolism. Air is inhaled through the nose or mouth, passes through the pharynx, larynx, and trachea, and enters the lungs through the left and right bronchi, which branch progressively into smaller bronchioles terminating in millions of microscopic air sacs (alveoli). The alveoli are surrounded by a dense capillary network; gases diffuse across the thin alveolar–capillary membrane down their concentration gradients (oxygen into the blood, carbon dioxide into the alveoli). The lungs are ventilated by the coordinated action of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. Breathing rate and depth are regulated by the respiratory centers in the brainstem, responding to blood levels of CO₂ and pH. The adult human lungs contain approximately 300–500 million alveoli with a total gas-exchange surface area of 70–100 square meters.</p>

  <h2>The Digestive and Endocrine Systems</h2>

  <p>The digestive system breaks down food into molecules small enough to be absorbed into the bloodstream and used by cells. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a muscular tube approximately nine meters long that runs from mouth to anus. Digestion begins in the mouth (mechanical breakdown by chewing; chemical breakdown of starch by salivary amylase) and continues in the stomach (churning; protein digestion by pepsin in acidic gastric juice) and small intestine (the principal site of chemical digestion and nutrient absorption, aided by enzymes secreted by the pancreas and bile from the liver). The small intestine's absorptive surface is dramatically increased by folds, finger-like projections (villi), and microscopic projections on each cell (microvilli), giving a total surface area of roughly 250 square meters. Absorbed nutrients pass into the portal venous system to the liver for processing and storage. The large intestine absorbs water and electrolytes and harbors a complex microbiome of trillions of bacteria that produce vitamins and assist in digestion.</p>

  <p>The endocrine system regulates body functions through hormones — chemical messengers secreted into the bloodstream by endocrine glands and carried to target organs throughout the body. Major endocrine glands include the pituitary (the "master gland" that regulates other endocrine glands), the thyroid (regulates metabolism through thyroxine), the adrenal glands (produce cortisol, adrenaline, and other hormones in response to stress), the pancreas (produces insulin and glucagon to regulate blood glucose), the gonads (testes and ovaries, producing sex hormones), and the parathyroid glands (regulating calcium metabolism). The hypothalamus in the brain integrates nervous and endocrine signaling, responding to neural inputs and blood-borne signals to regulate the pituitary and thereby orchestrate responses to changing conditions.</p>

  <h2>Anatomy Through History</h2>

  <p>Human anatomy has a rich history intertwined with the development of medicine, art, and science. In ancient Greece, Hippocrates and his followers accumulated empirical anatomical knowledge, and Galen of Pergamon (2nd century AD) produced an influential but error-laden synthesis based largely on animal dissections that dominated Western medicine for over a millennium. The Renaissance brought a transformation: Andreas Vesalius, a Flemish physician working in Padua, performed systematic human dissections and published his monumental <em>De Humani Corporis Fabrica</em> (1543), which corrected hundreds of Galenic errors and established the standard of direct empirical observation as the basis of anatomical knowledge. Vesalius's work, magnificently illustrated by artists from the workshop of Titian, is often considered the beginning of modern anatomy and modern scientific medicine.</p>

  <p>Subsequent centuries brought further advances: Harvey's discovery of the circulation (1628), Marcello Malpighi's microscopic discovery of capillaries (1661) completing Harvey's circuit, the development of histology following the improvement of microscopes in the nineteenth century, Henry Gray's landmark <em>Anatomy of the Human Body</em> (first edition 1858), and the twentieth-century revolution in imaging — X-rays, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound — that allows the living body to be examined non-invasively in extraordinary detail. Modern anatomy is deeply integrated with cell biology, molecular biology, and developmental biology, and the ongoing project of understanding human structure at all scales — from the molecular machinery of individual cells to the whole-body organization captured by medical imaging — continues to drive advances in medicine and biological science.</p>
