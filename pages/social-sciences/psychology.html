  <p>Psychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior — the mental processes, emotions, perceptions, cognitions, and actions of individuals, as well as the social and biological factors that influence them. It sits at the intersection of the natural and social sciences, drawing on neuroscience, biology, and evolutionary theory from one side, and on sociology, philosophy, and anthropology from the other. Psychology addresses questions ranging from the neural mechanisms of memory to the social determinants of attitude change, from the development of language in infants to the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.</p>

  <p>Psychology's prehistory lies in philosophy — questions about the nature of mind, consciousness, knowledge, and emotion were central to ancient Greek philosophy and to early modern thinkers including Descartes, Hume, and Locke. The discipline achieved independence as a science when Wilhelm Wundt established the first experimental psychology laboratory at the University of Leipzig in 1879, applying rigorous experimental methods to the study of sensation, perception, and reaction time. The subsequent century saw the rise and fall of competing schools — structuralism, functionalism, behaviorism, psychoanalysis, Gestalt psychology, cognitive psychology — as psychologists debated what the discipline should study and how. Today, scientific psychology is methodologically pluralistic, empirically rigorous, and deeply engaged with the neurosciences through the overlapping field of cognitive neuroscience.</p>

  <h2>The Major Schools of Psychology</h2>

  <p>Structuralism, the first school of experimental psychology, was developed by Wundt and systematized by Edward Titchener. It aimed to analyze the structure of conscious experience by breaking it into its elementary components — sensations, images, and feelings — using the method of introspection (the trained self-observation of one's own mental states). Functionalism, associated with William James and John Dewey, rejected this atomistic approach and asked instead how mental processes function — what they do, how they help organisms adapt to their environments. James's <em>Principles of Psychology</em> (1890) remains a foundational text of the field, notable for its rich phenomenological descriptions of consciousness and its evolutionary perspective on mental life.</p>

  <p>Behaviorism, founded by John Watson in 1913 and developed by B.F. Skinner, argued that psychology should restrict itself to the study of observable behavior and abandon the study of unobservable mental states. Skinner's operant conditioning framework — in which behavior is shaped by its consequences (reinforcements and punishments) — provided a powerful account of how behavior is learned and maintained, with extensive practical applications in education, animal training, and behavioral therapy. Psychoanalysis, created by Sigmund Freud, proposed that unconscious mental processes — repressed memories, desires, and conflicts — are the primary drivers of behavior and psychopathology, and that the therapeutic method of free association could bring them to consciousness. The cognitive revolution of the 1950s and 1960s overthrew behaviorist orthodoxy, reintroducing mental processes — perception, attention, memory, reasoning, language — as legitimate objects of scientific study, modeled on information-processing frameworks drawn from computer science.</p>

  <h2>Perception, Cognition, and Memory</h2>

  <p>Cognitive psychology studies the mental processes involved in acquiring, storing, transforming, and using knowledge. Perception — the process by which sensory information is organized and interpreted — is an active and constructive process rather than a passive recording of the world; the brain uses prior knowledge, expectations, and context to interpret ambiguous sensory input. Gestalt psychology (Wertheimer, Köhler, Koffka) demonstrated that perceptual experience has properties that cannot be reduced to the sum of its parts — the whole is different from the sum — and identified principles of perceptual organization (proximity, similarity, closure, and continuity) that govern how elements are grouped into unified percepts.</p>

  <p>Memory is conventionally divided into sensory memory (very brief retention of sensory information), short-term memory (limited-capacity, brief-duration storage of information currently being processed, corresponding roughly to "working memory"), and long-term memory (essentially unlimited-capacity, long-duration storage). Long-term memory is further subdivided into explicit (declarative) memory — conscious memories of facts (semantic memory) and personal experiences (episodic memory) — and implicit (non-declarative) memory — unconscious procedural skills, conditioned responses, and priming effects. The landmark case of patient H.M. (Henry Molaison), who following hippocampal resection could no longer form new explicit memories but retained intact implicit memory and previously learned skills, established the critical role of the hippocampus in consolidating explicit memories and revealed the multiple dissociable memory systems of the brain.</p>

  <h2>Motivation and Emotion</h2>

  <p>Motivation encompasses the internal states and processes that initiate, direct, and sustain goal-oriented behavior. Drive theories, influential in the mid-twentieth century, proposed that motivational states arise from physiological needs (hunger, thirst, sex) that create drives — aversive states that motivate behavior to reduce them and restore homeostasis. Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs (1943) proposed a more holistic motivational theory, arguing that basic physiological and safety needs must be met before higher-level needs for belonging, esteem, and self-actualization become motivating. Intrinsic motivation — doing something for the inherent satisfaction of the activity itself — has been distinguished from extrinsic motivation (doing something for external rewards), and research by Deci and Ryan on self-determination theory has shown that conditions supporting autonomy, competence, and relatedness foster intrinsic motivation and psychological well-being.</p>

  <p>Emotion is a multifaceted response involving physiological arousal, subjective experience, cognitive appraisal, and behavioral expression. Fundamental theoretical debates concern whether emotions are discrete categories (anger, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, disgust — Paul Ekman's basic emotions) or dimensional states varying along axes of valence (pleasant–unpleasant) and arousal; whether physiological arousal precedes emotional experience (James-Lange theory) or follows from it (Cannon-Bard theory); and the role of cognitive appraisal (Schachter-Singer theory, Lazarus's appraisal theory). Affective neuroscience, pioneered by Jaak Panksepp, identifies subcortical brain systems — including the amygdala for fear and the reward circuitry of the ventral striatum — that support basic emotional responses.</p>

  <h2>Developmental Psychology</h2>

  <p>Developmental psychology studies the psychological changes that occur across the human lifespan, from conception through old age. Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development proposed that children's thinking passes through four qualitatively distinct stages — sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational — each characterized by distinctive modes of understanding the world, driven by the processes of assimilation (incorporating new information into existing cognitive schemas) and accommodation (modifying schemas to fit new information). Lev Vygotsky, working in the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1930s, emphasized the social and cultural dimensions of cognitive development, proposing that higher mental functions are internalized from social interactions and that children's learning is scaffolded by adults and more capable peers within the "zone of proximal development."</p>

  <p>Erik Erikson's psychosocial theory proposed eight stages of development from infancy to old age, each characterized by a central conflict whose resolution shapes personality. Attachment theory, developed by John Bowlby and empirically elaborated by Mary Ainsworth, holds that the quality of early emotional bonds between infants and caregivers profoundly shapes emotional development, social relationships, and psychological well-being across the lifespan. Ainsworth's Strange Situation procedure identified four patterns of infant attachment — secure, anxious-ambivalent, anxious-avoidant, and disorganized — linked to caregiver sensitivity and predictive of later social and emotional outcomes. Developmental neuroscience has illuminated the biological substrates of developmental change, including the protracted maturation of the prefrontal cortex (not fully mature until the mid-twenties) that underlies the well-documented differences in executive function and impulse control between adolescents and adults.</p>

  <h2>Social Psychology</h2>

  <p>Social psychology examines how individuals are influenced by other people and by the social contexts in which they are embedded. Classic experiments established that even basic perceptual and cognitive processes are susceptible to social influence: Solomon Asch's conformity experiments (1951–1956) demonstrated that individuals would publicly endorse obviously incorrect perceptual judgments to conform to unanimous group consensus. Stanley Milgram's obedience experiments (1960s) showed that ordinary people would administer apparently dangerous electric shocks to strangers when instructed to do so by an authority figure — a disturbing demonstration of the power of authority and social context over individual behavior. Philip Zimbardo's Stanford prison experiment (1971), though methodologically controversial, highlighted the power of institutional roles in shaping behavior.</p>

  <p>Attitude formation and change have been central concerns of social psychology. Cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger) proposes that inconsistency between an attitude and a behavior creates psychological discomfort that motivates change in one or the other. Attribution theory examines how people explain the causes of behavior — whether they attribute it to stable dispositions of the actor (dispositional attribution) or to features of the situation (situational attribution). The fundamental attribution error — the tendency to over-attribute others' behavior to disposition while underweighting situational factors — is one of the most robust findings of social psychology. Social identity theory (Tajfel and Turner) examines how membership in social groups shapes self-concept and intergroup relations, providing a psychological account of prejudice, discrimination, and intergroup conflict.</p>
