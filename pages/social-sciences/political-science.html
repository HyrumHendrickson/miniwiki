  <p>Political science is the systematic study of governments, political processes, political behavior, power relations, and public policies. It encompasses the analysis of how authority is acquired and exercised, how political institutions are structured and function, what drives political decisions and outcomes, and how societies organize collective life through governance. Political science draws on history, philosophy, economics, sociology, and psychology, using methods ranging from formal mathematical modeling and statistical analysis of large datasets to in-depth case studies and comparative historical research.</p>

  <p>Political inquiry has ancient roots: Aristotle's <em>Politics</em>, written in the fourth century BC, systematically analyzed the constitutions of Greek city-states, classified forms of government, and asked what institutions best promote human flourishing. But political science as a modern academic discipline — self-consciously empirical, systematic, and distinct from philosophy and history — emerged primarily in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries with the professionalization of universities and the development of social scientific methods. Today it is a diverse field encompassing normative political theory (which asks what ought to be), empirical political science (which asks what is and why), and the increasingly blurred border between them in the study of democracy, rights, and justice.</p>

  <h2>Political Theory and the Nature of Government</h2>

  <p>Political theory examines the fundamental questions of political life: What justifies political authority? What are the proper limits of government power? What rights do individuals have against the state? What constitutes justice in the distribution of goods and opportunities? The social contract tradition, represented by Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, provides one influential framework. Hobbes, writing in the shadow of the English Civil War, argued in <em>Leviathan</em> (1651) that without government, life in the "state of nature" would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short" — a war of all against all — and that individuals rationally consent to an absolute sovereign to escape this condition. Locke, by contrast, argued in his <em>Two Treatises of Government</em> (1689) that individuals possess natural rights to life, liberty, and property that precede and constrain government; government is legitimate only when it protects these rights, and the people may revolt when it fails to do so.</p>

  <p>Rousseau's conception of the social contract, expressed in <em>Du Contrat Social</em> (1762), centered on the concept of the "general will" — the common good of the community — and argued that legitimate authority derives from popular sovereignty. The liberal tradition, building on Locke and elaborated by Kant, Mill, and in the twentieth century by John Rawls, prioritizes individual liberty and rights and subjects collective decisions to standards of fairness and equal concern. Rawls's <em>A Theory of Justice</em> (1971), which argued that just institutions are those that rational persons would choose behind a "veil of ignorance" about their place in society, has been one of the most influential works of political philosophy of the twentieth century. Communitarian, republican, feminist, and post-colonial critiques of liberal theory have broadened and complicated the field.</p>

  <h2>Forms of Government</h2>

  <p>Governments have taken an enormous variety of forms across history and cultures. Aristotle's classic typology classified governments by who rules and in whose interest: monarchy (rule by one for the common good), aristocracy (rule by the few for the common good), and polity (rule by the many for the common good) — and their corrupted counterparts tyranny, oligarchy, and democracy. Modern political science classifies regimes along a spectrum from fully authoritarian to fully democratic, with many hybrid forms in between. Democratic regimes are characterized by competitive elections, civil liberties, rule of law, and accountability of rulers to the ruled. Authoritarian regimes concentrate power and restrict political competition and civil liberties; they include military dictatorships, single-party states, personal dictatorships, and theocracies.</p>

  <p>Within democratic systems, major structural variations include presidential systems (in which executive and legislative powers are separated, as in the United States), parliamentary systems (in which the executive is drawn from and accountable to the legislature, as in the United Kingdom and most European democracies), and semi-presidential systems (combining elements of both, as in France). Federal systems divide authority between a central government and constituent units (states, provinces, or cantons), while unitary systems concentrate sovereignty in the central government. Electoral systems — including proportional representation, single-member plurality (first-past-the-post), and mixed systems — profoundly shape the number and character of political parties and the nature of representation.</p>

  <h2>Democratic Theory and Practice</h2>

  <p>Democracy — from the Greek <em>demos</em> (people) and <em>kratos</em> (rule) — is the dominant form of government in the contemporary world and the central subject of normative and empirical political science. Liberal democracy combines popular sovereignty (the people are the ultimate source of political authority) with the protection of individual rights and the rule of law. Representative democracy delegates decision-making to elected representatives accountable to citizens; direct democracy involves citizens making decisions directly through referenda and initiatives. The minimum conditions for democracy are contested, but most theorists emphasize free and fair elections, universal suffrage, freedom of expression and association, and peaceful transfers of power.</p>

  <p>Democratic consolidation — the process by which new democracies become stable — and democratic backsliding — the erosion of democratic norms and institutions in previously consolidated democracies — are major preoccupations of contemporary comparative politics. Research has identified economic development, a strong civil society, an independent judiciary, civilian control of the military, and political culture as important factors in democratic stability. The "third wave" of democratization (Samuel Huntington's term) that began with Portugal's Carnation Revolution in 1974 and expanded through Latin America, Eastern Europe, parts of Asia, and Africa brought the number of electoral democracies to its highest historical level by the early twenty-first century, though the trend has been challenged by authoritarian resurgence in recent years.</p>

  <h2>International Relations</h2>

  <p>International relations (IR) examines interactions among states and other actors in the international system — diplomacy, war, trade, international organizations, norms, and the governance of global commons. Realism, the dominant IR paradigm of the twentieth century, holds that states are the primary actors in international politics, that they are driven by the pursuit of power and security in an anarchic international system (one without a central authority), and that conflict is endemic. Classical realists such as Thucydides and Hans Morgenthau emphasized the primacy of power and national interest; structural (neo-)realists such as Kenneth Waltz located the sources of conflict in the structure of the international system rather than human nature.</p>

  <p>Liberalism in IR emphasizes the potential for cooperation, international institutions, economic interdependence, and the democratic peace — the well-documented empirical finding that democracies very rarely go to war with each other. Liberal institutionalists argue that international organizations and regimes (the United Nations, World Trade Organization, international treaties) can overcome the collective action problems that prevent cooperative outcomes in an anarchic system. Constructivism, a major perspective that emerged in the 1990s, holds that international politics is shaped not only by material factors (military and economic power) but by ideas, identities, norms, and shared understandings that are socially constructed and can change. Contemporary IR also grapples with transnational challenges including terrorism, nuclear proliferation, climate change, pandemics, and cyber conflict that cut across traditional state-centric frameworks.</p>

  <h2>Public Policy and Governance</h2>

  <p>Public policy is the study of the decisions governments make — laws, regulations, expenditures, and administrative arrangements — and their consequences for society. Policy analysis draws on economics, sociology, organizational theory, and political science to understand how policy problems are defined, how alternatives are formulated, how decisions are made, and how policies are implemented and evaluated. The policy process is rarely rational and linear; it is shaped by interest group lobbying, bureaucratic politics, electoral incentives, cognitive limitations of decision-makers, and the path dependence of existing institutions. Agenda-setting theory examines how some issues come to command attention while others remain neglected.</p>

  <p>Governance refers to the processes and structures through which collective decisions are made, extending beyond formal government to include networks of public agencies, private actors, and civil society organizations. New Public Management, influential since the 1980s, sought to reform government bureaucracies by introducing market mechanisms, performance measurement, and managerial autonomy. Evidence-based policy aims to ground government decisions in rigorous empirical research rather than ideology or anecdote, though the translation of research into policy faces persistent challenges of political resistance, institutional inertia, and the complexity of social systems. Comparative public policy examines how different countries address similar problems — healthcare, education, social protection, environmental regulation — and what explains the substantial variation in policy designs and outcomes across nations.</p>
