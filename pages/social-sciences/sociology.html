  <p>Sociology is the scientific study of human society — its structures, institutions, cultures, patterns of interaction, and processes of social change. It examines how individuals are shaped by their social contexts and, conversely, how their actions collectively produce and reproduce social structures. Sociology asks fundamental questions: How is social order maintained? Why do inequalities persist? How do norms and values spread and change? What drives social movements and revolutions? How do large-scale processes like urbanization, globalization, and technological change reshape the texture of everyday life?</p>

  <p>The discipline emerged in the nineteenth century in response to the profound disruptions of industrialization, urbanization, and political revolution that were transforming European society. Auguste Comte, who coined the term "sociologie" in 1838, conceived of it as a "positive science" of society that would apply the methods of natural science to human social life and thereby provide a rational basis for social reform. Émile Durkheim, Karl Marx, and Max Weber — often called the "founding trinity" of sociology — established the theoretical foundations of the field through landmark studies of suicide, capitalism, and religious life that demonstrated both the distinctiveness of social phenomena and the power of systematic empirical analysis to illuminate them.</p>

  <h2>The Sociological Imagination</h2>

  <p>The sociological imagination — a concept developed by the American sociologist C. Wright Mills in his influential 1959 book of the same name — is the capacity to see the relationship between individual experience and the larger social forces that shape it. The personal troubles of individuals — unemployment, divorce, addiction, illness — are often rooted in public issues: the structure of the economy, the organization of family life, the distribution of power. To understand a person's biography, Mills argued, we must understand the historical and social context in which that biography unfolds. This insight — that what seems personal is often social — is the core of the sociological perspective and distinguishes it from purely individualist accounts of human behavior.</p>

  <p>The sociological imagination challenges "common sense" understandings of the social world by revealing the invisible structures, norms, and power relations that shape what we take to be natural or inevitable. Berger and Luckmann's concept of the "social construction of reality" (1966) argues that much of what we experience as objective social reality — gender roles, racial categories, economic arrangements — is not given by nature but is produced and maintained through ongoing social interaction and institutional practices. This constructivist insight has been enormously influential across sociology and the humanities, though it has also generated debate about the extent to which social construction undermines claims of objective knowledge and political critique.</p>

  <h2>Social Structure and Institutions</h2>

  <p>Social structure refers to the enduring patterns of social relationships and social positions that organize human life independently of the particular individuals who occupy them. Key structural concepts include role (the set of behaviors expected of a person in a given social position), status (a person's position in the social hierarchy, ascribed by birth or achieved through action), and institution (an established pattern of norms and roles organized around a fundamental social need). The major social institutions — the family, the economy, the state, religion, and education — channel individual behavior into predictable forms and provide the stable organizational framework within which social life occurs.</p>

  <p>Émile Durkheim's concept of social facts — collective phenomena that are external to and constrain individuals, such as laws, customs, and moral codes — established the distinctive ontology of sociology: society is not merely the sum of its individual members but an emergent entity with properties irreducible to individual psychology. Durkheim's study <em>Suicide</em> (1897) demonstrated that even so apparently personal an act as suicide varied systematically with social variables (levels of social integration and moral regulation), providing a founding demonstration of the sociological method. Max Weber, complementing Durkheim's structural focus, emphasized the importance of understanding the subjective meaning that actors attach to their behavior (<em>Verstehen</em>), and examined how cultural values — particularly the Protestant ethic — shaped the development of capitalist institutions.</p>

  <h2>Culture and Society</h2>

  <p>Culture — the shared meanings, values, norms, beliefs, symbols, and practices that characterize a social group — is one of the central concepts of sociology. Culture both enables and constrains social life: it provides the shared frameworks of meaning through which people interpret their world and coordinate their actions, and it defines the boundaries of the normal and acceptable. High culture (elite artistic and intellectual production) and popular culture (mass-produced entertainment and everyday cultural consumption) are sociologically significant domains, as are subcultures (the distinctive cultures of specific social groups that may partially diverge from the dominant culture) and countercultures (groups that actively reject or oppose dominant norms).</p>

  <p>Pierre Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital — the knowledge, skills, tastes, and cultural references that confer social advantages and disadvantages — linked culture to class inequality, showing how access to cultural resources shapes educational attainment and occupational outcomes independently of economic capital. The sociology of knowledge examines how social location influences what counts as knowledge and whose perspectives are recognized as authoritative. Cultural globalization — the worldwide spread of cultural products, media, consumer goods, and practices — raises questions about cultural homogenization versus hybridization and the power relations between cultural producers in wealthy nations and consumers in poorer ones.</p>

  <h2>Social Stratification and Inequality</h2>

  <p>Social stratification refers to the hierarchical arrangement of individuals and groups in a society according to dimensions of inequality — class, status, power, race, gender, age, and others. Karl Marx's analysis of capitalism identified class — determined by one's relationship to the means of production (whether one owns capital or must sell one's labor) — as the fundamental axis of social inequality, and class conflict as the engine of historical change. Max Weber distinguished among class (economic position), status (social prestige), and party (power), arguing that stratification is multidimensional and cannot be reduced to economic relations alone. Modern sociologists have studied how these dimensions intersect and reinforce each other in systems of "intersectionality" — a concept developed by Kimberlé Crenshaw to analyze how race, gender, class, and other social categories mutually constitute systems of privilege and oppression.</p>

  <p>Social mobility — movement between positions in the stratification hierarchy — can be intergenerational (comparing children's positions to their parents') or intragenerational (movement within an individual's own lifetime). Research across many societies finds that actual social mobility falls far short of the ideals expressed in "meritocratic" ideologies, with family background, neighborhood, and school quality powerfully predicting adult outcomes. The sociology of poverty examines its structural causes and consequences, the mechanisms through which it is reproduced across generations, and the effectiveness of social policies aimed at reducing it. Gender stratification — the systematic disadvantaging of women in terms of economic resources, political power, and social status — has been extensively studied and has proven highly resistant to change despite significant legal and normative shifts over the past century.</p>

  <h2>Social Change and Modernity</h2>

  <p>Social change — the transformation of social structures, institutions, and cultures over time — is one of the central preoccupations of sociology. Theorists of modernity from Marx, Durkheim, and Weber to Jürgen Habermas, Anthony Giddens, and Zygmunt Bauman have sought to characterize the distinctive features of modern society and the processes of transformation from traditional to modern forms. Weber analyzed the rationalization of social life — the spread of formal, calculative, rule-governed action into ever more domains — and its consequences for meaning and freedom, captured in his metaphor of the "iron cage" of bureaucracy. Durkheim traced the transition from mechanical solidarity (based on similarity and collective conscience) to organic solidarity (based on functional interdependence in a complex division of labor).</p>

  <p>Social movements — organized, sustained efforts by groups of people to bring about or resist social change — have been a major focus of sociological research. Resource mobilization theory examines how movements acquire and deploy resources (money, leadership, organizational capacity, media access) to achieve their goals. Political process theory focuses on the political opportunities that enable or constrain movement emergence and success. Cultural approaches examine how movements construct collective identities and frame their grievances and demands. Contemporary sociology addresses new challenges including the sociology of the Internet and digital social life, the social consequences of climate change, the sociology of migration and transnationalism, and the contested boundaries of national identity in an increasingly interconnected world.</p>
