  <p>Folk and traditional music encompasses the vast range of music created and transmitted within communities — the songs, dances, instrumental pieces, and ritual music that have been passed from generation to generation primarily through oral tradition, without notation. It is distinguished from both art music (composed by identified individual composers, transmitted through notation and formal training) and commercial popular music (produced for mass consumption through the music industry) by its community rootedness, its oral transmission, and its role as a living expression of cultural identity. Folk music belongs to the people who make it: it is shaped by local conditions, adapted to local needs, and varies continuously as it is transmitted.</p>

  <p>The study of folk and traditional music — ethnomusicology — examines music in its social and cultural context, asking not only what music sounds like but what it means and does within the community that creates and uses it. The pioneering work of collectors such as Cecil Sharp (English folk songs), Francis James Child (Scottish and English ballads), Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály (Hungarian and Romanian folk music), and Alan Lomax (American folk, blues, and roots music) preserved vast quantities of traditional music that might otherwise have been lost as oral traditions were disrupted by modernization. Their recordings, transcriptions, and analyses form an invaluable archive of musical diversity.</p>

  <h2>Characteristics of Folk Music</h2>

  <p>Despite the enormous diversity of folk and traditional music across the world's cultures, certain characteristics tend to recur. Oral transmission is the defining feature: folk music is learned by ear from other people, not from notation. This mode of transmission makes folk music inherently variable and adaptive: each performance is unique, and each generation remolds the tradition. Anonymity is common — many folk songs have no identified composer, having been created collectively or so long ago that the original composer is forgotten; others do have known origins but have entered the common repertoire through community adoption. Community function is central: folk music is created and performed within specific social contexts — weddings, harvests, funerals, religious ceremonies, work, play, courtship — and its meaning is inseparable from those contexts.</p>

  <p>Melodically, folk music frequently uses modal scales (Dorian, Mixolydian, pentatonic) rather than the major-minor system of Western art music, giving it a distinctive character that composers including Bartók, Vaughan Williams, and Dvořák found a welcome alternative to the "worn-out" progressions of late Romantic harmony. Rhythmically, folk music often features irregular or asymmetrical meters — Bulgarian folk music is famous for its complex meters such as 7/8, 11/8, and 15/16 — as well as complex polyrhythms and rhythmic improvisation. Texturally, folk music ranges from solo unaccompanied singing to heterophonic ensembles in which multiple performers simultaneously play variations of the same melody, to complex polyphonic vocal traditions such as Georgian polyphony and Bulgarian women's choir singing.</p>

  <h2>Regional Traditions</h2>

  <p>The British Isles have one of the best-documented folk music traditions in the world, thanks to the intensive collecting work of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The tradition encompasses songs in many genres — ballads (narrative songs telling stories of love, murder, the supernatural, and historical events), work songs, dance tunes (reels, jigs, hornpipes, strathspeys), and children's songs — and instrumental music dominated by the fiddle, uilleann pipes (Irish bagpipes), tin whistle, and frame drum (bodhrán). The music of Ireland and Scotland has been particularly influential, spreading through emigration to North America, Australia, and beyond and feeding into the development of Appalachian and old-time music.</p>

  <p>West African musical traditions have had incalculable influence on world music through the African diaspora. Characterized by complex polyrhythm, call-and-response singing, and the central role of percussion, West African music forms the rhythmic and structural foundation of African American music traditions including blues, jazz, gospel, soul, funk, hip-hop, and their global derivatives. The griot tradition of West Africa — professional musician-storytellers who maintain the oral histories and genealogies of communities through song and instrumental performance, accompanying themselves on the kora (a 21-string harp-lute), ngoni, and other instruments — represents one of the richest traditions of functional music in the world. Eastern European folk music, particularly from Bulgaria, Romania, the Balkans, and Ukraine, is renowned for its rhythmic complexity, rich polyphony, and distinctive ornamental vocal styles that have attracted wide international attention since recordings became available in the late twentieth century.</p>

  <h2>Folk Music and National Identity</h2>

  <p>The relationship between folk music and national identity has been both productive and politically fraught. In the nineteenth century, as nationalist movements arose across Europe seeking to forge or assert distinct national identities, folk music was discovered and deployed as an authentic expression of the "soul" of the people — a pure, uncorrupted musical heritage unsullied by the cosmopolitan influences of art music. Collectors and composers used folk melodies as raw material for musical nationalism: Antonín Dvořák incorporated Bohemian and Native American pentatonic elements in his works, Edvard Grieg drew on Norwegian folk music, Jean Sibelius on Finnish folk poetry (the Kalevala), and Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály systematically collected and analyzed Hungarian, Romanian, and Bulgarian folk music and incorporated its scales, rhythms, and melodic patterns into their compositions.</p>

  <p>This nationalist appropriation of folk music was not without tensions. Questions arose about who had the right to collect, arrange, and publish folk songs; what the consequences were for the communities whose music was taken; and whether the process of transcription and concert performance inevitably distorted and decontextualized the music. In the twentieth century, totalitarian regimes in the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, and elsewhere also instrumentalized folk music for nationalist and ideological purposes, creating state-sponsored folk ensembles that performed sanitized, professionalized versions of folk traditions stripped of their improvisatory vitality. These experiences complicated the romantic association of folk music with authenticity and national essence and prompted more critical, culturally sensitive approaches to ethnomusicology.</p>

  <h2>The Folk Revival of the 20th Century</h2>

  <p>The twentieth century saw several waves of folk music revival, in which urban intellectuals and musicians rediscovered, performed, and promoted rural and working-class folk traditions. In the United States, the folk revival of the 1930s–1950s was associated with figures including Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and the Weavers, who used folk song as a vehicle for left-wing politics, labor organizing, and social commentary. Alan Lomax's field recordings for the Library of Congress created an archive of American folk music and brought previously obscure artists including Lead Belly and Muddy Waters to wider attention. The second folk revival of the late 1950s–1960s, centered in Greenwich Village in New York, brought acoustic folk music to mainstream popular audiences and launched the careers of Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, and Peter, Paul and Mary before Dylan controversially "went electric" at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival.</p>

  <p>In Britain, the parallel folk revival of the 1950s–1970s — associated with Ewan MacColl, A.L. Lloyd, and later with performers including Fairport Convention, Steeleye Span, and the Pentangle — similarly sought to bring traditional English, Scottish, and Irish material to new audiences, often adapting it to contemporary styles and instrumentation. The Irish traditional music revival, centered in Dublin and in the diaspora, produced influential recordings and festivals (including the Fleadh Cheoil, founded in 1951) and helped transform Irish traditional music from a rural survival into a globally popular genre. Folk revivals have occurred in nearly every country in the world, taking different forms depending on local social, political, and musical contexts, and the tension between preservation of traditional forms and creative adaptation remains central to their dynamics.</p>

  <h2>Folk Music and Its Influence on Popular Music</h2>

  <p>The boundary between folk and popular music has always been permeable. The blues, rooted in the work songs, field hollers, and folk ballads of the African American South, gave rise to rhythm and blues, rock and roll, and soul — the dominant forms of twentieth-century popular music. Country music, which evolved from the Anglo-Celtic folk traditions of Appalachia and the rural South, became one of the most commercially successful popular genres in America. Bluegrass, developed by Bill Monroe in the 1940s, deliberately preserved and formalized the fast-tempo, high-lonesome sound of older string band music, creating a neo-traditional genre that has influenced folk, country, and rock.</p>

  <p>More recently, world music — a somewhat contested category encompassing non-Western and traditional music marketed to international audiences — has brought diverse folk traditions including West African griot music, Andean music, Indian classical and folk music, Celtic music, and Afrobeat to global audiences. Artists including Paul Simon (whose <em>Graceland</em>, 1986, incorporated South African township music), Peter Gabriel (a champion of world music through his WOMAD festivals), and Youssou N'Dour have been important brokers between folk and traditional music and the international popular music market. The tension between the commercial benefits of international exposure and the risks of cultural appropriation, decontextualization, and exploitation of traditional musicians and their communities remains a central ethical concern in world music.</p>
