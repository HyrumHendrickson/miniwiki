  <p>The <strong>American Founding</strong> refers to the period of political and intellectual activity between the 1760s and the ratification of the Constitution in 1788 and the Bill of Rights in 1791, in which the American colonists declared independence from Great Britain, fought and won the Revolutionary War, and established a constitutional republic that has endured — imperfectly but remarkably — for more than two centuries. It is among the most consequential acts of political creation in the history of the world.</p>

  <p>What makes the American Founding genuinely exceptional is not merely that it succeeded militarily or that it produced durable institutions, but that it was explicitly grounded in a philosophy — the philosophy of natural law and natural rights — and in the conviction that legitimate government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed and exists to secure rights that precede it. This was not merely a political claim but a moral and ultimately theological one.</p>

  <div class="clearfix"></div>

  <h2>The Philosophical Inheritance</h2>

  <p>The Founders drew upon a rich inheritance of political thought. Classical republicanism — the tradition of Cicero, Polybius, and the Roman Republic — provided the model of mixed government and civic virtue. The English constitutional tradition — Magna Carta, the common law, and the parliamentary struggles of the seventeenth century — provided the immediate legal precedents. The natural rights philosophy of John Locke — particularly his argument that men possess rights to life, liberty, and property prior to and independent of government — provided the theoretical framework of the Declaration.</p>

  <p>But the Founders' philosophical synthesis was not merely secular. The vast majority of the Founders were serious Christians or, at minimum, theists who believed that the moral order they appealed to was grounded in the nature of the God who had created mankind. Jefferson's "Laws of Nature and of Nature's God" was a recognizable natural law formula; his claim that men are "endowed by their Creator" with rights was a theological claim. Benjamin Rush, John Adams, and Patrick Henry were explicit about the dependence of republican government on religious virtue in the citizenry.</p>

  <h2>The Declaration of Independence</h2>

  <p>The Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776) is the founding creed of the American Republic. Drafted primarily by Thomas Jefferson, with revisions by the Continental Congress, it performs three functions: it articulates a universal philosophy of human rights and legitimate government; it enumerates the specific grievances that justify revolution against the British Crown; and it proclaims the existence of the United States as an independent nation.</p>

  <p>Its most celebrated passage is among the most consequential sentences in the history of political thought:</p>

  <blockquote>
    We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
    <cite>Declaration of Independence, 1776</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The logic is tight and revolutionary. Rights are natural and God-given, not grants of government. Government's purpose is to secure those rights, not to define or bestow them. A government that fails this purpose forfeits its legitimacy. This is a classical natural law argument applied to the specific crisis of colonial governance — and it set in motion consequences that would eventually require the abolition of slavery, the extension of suffrage, and the vindication of rights long denied.</p>

  <h2>The Constitutional Convention</h2>

  <p>The Articles of Confederation (1781), the first frame of government for the United States, proved inadequate: the national government lacked the power to tax, regulate commerce, or enforce its own laws. The Constitutional Convention of 1787, meeting in Philadelphia under the presidency of George Washington, produced a document of remarkable durability and wisdom.</p>

  <p>The Constitution embodies several principles drawn from the classical and Enlightenment inheritance:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Separation of powers:</strong> The legislative, executive, and judicial branches are given distinct powers and arranged to check and balance each other, preventing the accumulation of tyrannical power in any one branch.</li>
    <li><strong>Federalism:</strong> Power is divided between the national government and the states, each sovereign in its own sphere.</li>
    <li><strong>Bicameralism:</strong> The legislature is divided into two chambers — the House of Representatives (proportional, closer to the people) and the Senate (equal state representation, providing a check on democratic passion).</li>
    <li><strong>Rule of law:</strong> The Constitution is the supreme law of the land; all government action is measured against it.</li>
    <li><strong>Limited government:</strong> The federal government possesses only the powers explicitly granted to it; all other powers are reserved to the states or the people.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Federalist Papers</h2>

  <p>The ratification debate produced one of the greatest works of political science in the English language: <em>The Federalist Papers</em>, eighty-five essays written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay under the pseudonym "Publius." The essays explain and defend the proposed Constitution, and in doing so provide the most authoritative commentary on its intent.</p>

  <p>Federalist No. 51, by Madison, contains the famous analysis of the structural problem of republican government:</p>

  <blockquote>
    If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.
    <cite>James Madison, Federalist No. 51</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>George Washington and the Precedent of Virtue</h2>

  <p>No figure in the American Founding is more important than George Washington, and his importance lies not chiefly in any single act or policy but in his character and the precedents he established. As commander of the Continental Army during eight years of war, he held an army together through privation, defeat, and near-collapse. At the war's end, when soldiers urged him to become a king, he disbanded the army and returned to his farm — an act that astonished the world. As the first President, he established every precedent of the executive branch and, most importantly, voluntarily relinquished power after two terms, demonstrating that republican government could endure.</p>

  <p>Washington's Farewell Address (1796) remains among the wisest statements of the conditions necessary for the survival of republican government: the indispensability of religion and morality to public virtue; the dangers of faction and partisan spirit; the necessity of avoiding entangling foreign alliances; and the importance of education, public credit, and national union.</p>

  <h2>American Exceptionalism</h2>

  <p>The concept of American exceptionalism — the idea that the United States occupies a unique and providential role in history — has roots in the Puritan vision of a "city on a hill" (John Winthrop, 1630) and finds expression throughout the Founding era. What makes America exceptional is not a claim of American superiority in every respect but the specific character of the principles it embodied: that human beings possess natural rights grounded in their God-given nature; that legitimate government derives from consent; and that a free people, virtuous and self-governing, can sustain republican institutions across generations.</p>

    <div class="wiki-callout-title">Lincoln on the Founding</div>
    <p>Abraham Lincoln, in the Gettysburg Address and his other great speeches, saw his task as preserving and fulfilling the promise of the Founding rather than departing from it. The Declaration, for Lincoln, was the "apple of gold" — the moral proposition — and the Constitution was the "frame of silver" built around it to protect it. The Civil War was fought to vindicate the Declaration's claim that all men are created equal.</p>
