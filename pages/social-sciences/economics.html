  <p>Economics is the social science that studies how individuals, firms, governments, and other actors make decisions about the allocation of scarce resources — goods, services, time, labor, capital — to satisfy competing wants and needs. It examines the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, the behavior of markets, the determination of prices and wages, the causes of economic growth and recession, and the effects of government policy on economic outcomes. Economics is both a positive science (describing and explaining how economies function) and a normative one (evaluating outcomes against criteria of efficiency, equity, and welfare).</p>

  <p>The formal discipline of economics is conventionally traced to Adam Smith's <em>The Wealth of Nations</em> (1776), which argued that free markets, guided by the "invisible hand" of price signals, allocate resources efficiently without central direction, and that the division of labor is a powerful driver of productivity and growth. David Ricardo developed the theory of comparative advantage, showing that nations benefit from trade even when one country is more efficient at producing all goods. The nineteenth century also produced Marx's radical critique of capitalism, analyzing class conflict, exploitation, and the contradictions of capitalist accumulation. The twentieth century was dominated by Keynes, whose <em>General Theory</em> (1936) argued that markets could remain stuck in equilibrium at less than full employment and that government fiscal policy was needed to stabilize the economy — a framework that shaped economic policy for decades.</p>

  <h2>Microeconomics: Supply, Demand, and Markets</h2>

  <p>Microeconomics analyzes the behavior of individual economic agents — consumers, firms, and industries — and the markets in which they interact. The central tool of microeconomics is supply and demand analysis. The demand curve shows the quantity of a good that consumers are willing and able to buy at each price (all else equal); the law of demand states that quantity demanded falls as price rises. The supply curve shows the quantity that producers are willing and able to sell at each price; the law of supply states that quantity supplied rises as price rises. The equilibrium price and quantity are determined by the intersection of supply and demand, where the market clears — there is neither surplus nor shortage.</p>

  <p>Shifts in supply or demand — caused by changes in income, preferences, input costs, technology, or the prices of related goods — move the equilibrium and explain price and quantity changes in real markets. Consumer surplus (the difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay) and producer surplus (the difference between price received and minimum acceptable price) measure the gains from trade. Market failures — situations where unregulated markets fail to allocate resources efficiently — arise from externalities (costs or benefits not reflected in market prices, such as pollution), public goods (non-excludable, non-rival goods like national defense), information asymmetry (one party to a transaction knows more than the other), and market power (the ability of firms to influence prices). These market failures provide the economic rationale for government intervention.</p>

  <h2>Macroeconomics: National Output, Employment, and Inflation</h2>

  <p>Macroeconomics studies the economy as a whole — aggregate output (GDP), employment, price levels, economic growth, and the balance of payments. Gross domestic product (GDP), the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period, is the primary measure of economic activity. GDP can be measured from the expenditure side (consumption + investment + government spending + net exports = GDP) or from the income side (wages + profits + rents + interest = national income). Business cycles — the alternating periods of expansion and contraction in economic activity — are a central concern of macroeconomics. Recessions (periods of declining GDP) cause unemployment and reduced living standards; understanding their causes and appropriate policy responses has been one of the most contentious areas of economic thought.</p>

  <p>The two main tools of macroeconomic policy are fiscal policy (government taxing and spending, managed by elected governments) and monetary policy (control of the money supply and interest rates, typically managed by an independent central bank). Keynesian economics advocates using fiscal policy to stimulate demand during recessions. Monetarism, associated with Milton Friedman, argues that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon and that central banks should focus primarily on controlling the money supply. New Keynesian economics, the synthesis that now dominates mainstream macroeconomics, incorporates price and wage rigidities into modern general-equilibrium models and provides a framework for evaluating both fiscal and monetary policy. Inflation — the general rise in the price level — erodes purchasing power and is managed primarily through monetary policy; hyperinflations (extremely rapid price increases) have historically caused economic and social catastrophe.</p>

  <h2>Schools of Economic Thought</h2>

  <p>Economics has been shaped by several major schools of thought that have competed and influenced one another over centuries. Classical economics (Smith, Ricardo, Mill) emphasized free markets, the labor theory of value, and the self-regulating nature of market economies. Marxist economics offered a radical critique, arguing that capitalism systematically exploits workers and contains inherent contradictions that would lead to its eventual collapse. The marginalist revolution of the 1870s (Jevons, Menger, Walras) recast value theory in terms of marginal utility and laid the foundations of neoclassical economics, which remains the dominant academic paradigm, modeling rational utility-maximizing agents in competitive markets.</p>

  <p>The Austrian school (Mises, Hayek) stressed the role of dispersed knowledge and price signals in coordinating economic activity and was deeply skeptical of central planning and government intervention. Institutional economics emphasized the role of institutions — laws, customs, organizations — in shaping economic behavior. The behavioral economics revolution, pioneered by Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, and Richard Thaler, challenged the assumption of perfect rationality, documenting systematic cognitive biases and heuristics that cause people to deviate from the predictions of standard economic models — with profound implications for policy and market design. Development economics examines the processes by which poor countries can achieve economic growth and improve human welfare, drawing on the insights of Amartya Sen, Paul Rosenstein-Rodan, and others.</p>

  <h2>International Trade and Globalization</h2>

  <p>International economics examines the trade of goods and services across national borders, the movement of capital and labor, and the institutions that govern the global economy. Ricardo's principle of comparative advantage explains why trade benefits all parties even when one country can produce every good more efficiently than another: each country gains by specializing in the goods for which its opportunity cost is lowest and trading for the rest. Free trade increases the overall size of the economic pie but creates winners and losers within countries — those in sectors favored by imports face competition, while export sectors expand. The political economy of trade policy — tariffs, quotas, subsidies, and trade agreements — reflects this distributional conflict.</p>

  <p>The acceleration of economic globalization since the late twentieth century — driven by falling transport and communication costs, trade liberalization, and capital mobility — has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty in emerging economies, particularly in East and Southeast Asia, while contributing to wage stagnation and job displacement in manufacturing sectors of advanced economies. International monetary economics examines exchange rates, balance-of-payments adjustments, and the architecture of the international monetary system, including the roles of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. The global financial crisis of 2008–2009 demonstrated the systemic risks arising from interconnected global financial markets and prompted a rethinking of financial regulation and macroprudential policy.</p>

  <h2>Economics and Human Behavior</h2>

  <p>Traditional economics assumed that individuals are rational, self-interested, and capable of processing information perfectly to maximize their utility. Behavioral economics, drawing heavily on cognitive psychology, has systematically documented deviations from this model. Loss aversion — the tendency to weigh losses more heavily than equivalent gains — explains why people are reluctant to sell losing investments and why insurance is in high demand. Hyperbolic discounting — the tendency to strongly prefer immediate rewards over future ones — explains poor savings behavior and difficulty with self-control. Framing effects show that choices depend not just on the objective content of options but on how they are presented. The concept of "nudges" — designing choice architectures to steer people toward better decisions without restricting their options — has influenced public policy in areas from retirement savings to organ donation to energy conservation.</p>

  <p>Experimental economics, pioneered by Vernon Smith, subjects economic theories to controlled laboratory and field experiments, testing predictions about market behavior, bargaining, public goods provision, and auction design with real human subjects. Game theory — the mathematical study of strategic interaction — has become one of the most powerful tools in economics, illuminating everything from oligopoly pricing and bargaining to international trade negotiations and biological evolution. John Nash's concept of equilibrium in non-cooperative games (the Nash equilibrium) provides the dominant solution concept in economic analysis of strategic situations. The application of economic thinking to non-market domains — crime, education, marriage, political behavior, health — characterizes the "economic imperialism" that has expanded the discipline's reach across the social sciences.</p>
