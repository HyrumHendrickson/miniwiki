  <p>Astronomy is the natural science that studies celestial objects — stars, planets, moons, comets, asteroids, nebulae, galaxies — as well as the universe as a whole. It is among the oldest sciences, with records of systematic celestial observation extending back to ancient Babylon, Egypt, and Greece. Through the use of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and increasingly powerful instruments, astronomy has revealed a universe of staggering scale and complexity, from the rocky planets of our own solar system to the cosmic web of filaments and voids stretching across billions of light-years.</p>

  <p>The Scientific Revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was in large part an astronomical revolution. Nicolaus Copernicus challenged the geocentric model by proposing that the Earth and planets orbit the Sun. Galileo Galilei turned a telescope to the sky and discovered the moons of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, and the mountains of the Moon. Johannes Kepler derived the empirical laws of planetary motion from Tycho Brahe's meticulous observations. Isaac Newton then unified terrestrial and celestial mechanics, showing that the same force of gravity that governs falling bodies on Earth holds the planets in their orbits. These developments transformed astronomy from a descriptive catalogue of celestial positions into a physics-based science capable of deep explanation and prediction.</p>

  <h2>The Solar System</h2>

  <p>Our solar system consists of the Sun — a middle-aged star containing more than 99.8 percent of the system's total mass — together with eight planets, their moons, a belt of rocky asteroids between Mars and Jupiter, the icy Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, and the distant Oort Cloud, a vast reservoir of cometary nuclei. The four inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) are small, rocky bodies with solid surfaces; the four outer planets consist of two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune) with mantles of water, ammonia, and methane ice beneath their hydrogen-helium atmospheres. Jupiter is by far the largest planet, with a mass more than twice that of all other planets combined, and its Great Red Spot is a storm larger than Earth that has persisted for centuries.</p>

  <p>The solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant molecular cloud, leaving a spinning disk of gas and dust — the protoplanetary disk — from which the Sun and planets condensed. Study of the solar system has been revolutionized by space exploration: probes have visited every planet and many smaller bodies, returning detailed images and measurements. The Voyager spacecraft, launched in 1977, have now left the solar system entirely and entered interstellar space. Planetary science — the study of the origin, structure, geology, and atmospheres of planets and moons — has become a rich subdiscipline, revealing active volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io, subsurface oceans on Europa and Enceladus, complex hydrocarbon chemistry on Titan, and striking valley systems and ancient lakebeds on Mars.</p>

  <h2>Stars and Stellar Evolution</h2>

  <p>Stars are massive, luminous spheres of plasma held together by gravity and powered by nuclear fusion in their cores. The Sun is a typical star of spectral class G, with a surface temperature of about 5,778 K and a luminosity of 3.8 × 10²⁶ watts. In stellar cores, the fusion of hydrogen into helium releases the energy that supports the star against gravitational collapse and radiates outward as light and other electromagnetic radiation. The Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram, which plots stellar luminosity against surface temperature, revealed that most stars fall along a "main sequence" and that the position of a star on this diagram reflects its mass and evolutionary state.</p>

  <p>The life cycle of a star is determined primarily by its mass. Low-mass stars like the Sun spend billions of years on the main sequence, then expand into red giants as their hydrogen fuel is exhausted, shed their outer layers as a planetary nebula, and leave behind a dense white dwarf. High-mass stars burn far more rapidly and explosively, ending their lives in spectacular supernovae that seed the interstellar medium with heavy elements synthesized by nuclear fusion and by the explosive nucleosynthesis of the supernova itself. The remnants of massive stellar explosions are neutron stars (incredibly dense objects in which matter is compressed to nuclear density) or, for the most massive progenitors, black holes from which not even light can escape. Stellar populations, their ages, compositions, and spatial distributions, are key tracers of galactic structure and evolution.</p>

  <h2>Galaxies and the Large-Scale Structure</h2>

  <p>A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The Milky Way, our home galaxy, is a barred spiral galaxy containing an estimated 200–400 billion stars arranged in a disk roughly 100,000 light-years in diameter with a central bulge and a prominent central bar. Our solar system lies in one of the spiral arms, about 26,000 light-years from the galactic center. Galaxies are classified by their morphology: spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies (smooth, featureless, and roughly ellipsoidal), lenticular galaxies, and irregular galaxies that lack clear structure.</p>

  <p>Galaxies cluster together under gravity. The Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy (M31) are the two largest members of the Local Group, a cluster of some fifty galaxies. Larger galaxy clusters, like the Virgo Cluster containing thousands of galaxies, and superclusters spanning hundreds of millions of light-years, form the higher levels of the cosmic hierarchy. At the largest scales, the universe displays a "cosmic web" of galaxy filaments and sheets surrounding enormous voids — a structure that emerged from tiny quantum fluctuations in the early universe, amplified by gravity over cosmic time. Most if not all massive galaxies appear to harbor supermassive black holes at their centers; the Milky Way's central black hole, Sagittarius A*, has a mass about four million times that of the Sun.</p>

  <h2>Cosmology and the Big Bang</h2>

  <p>Cosmology is the study of the origin, evolution, and large-scale structure of the universe as a whole. The modern cosmological framework — the Big Bang model — holds that the universe originated approximately 13.8 billion years ago in an extremely hot, dense state and has been expanding and cooling ever since. The key observational pillars of this model are Edwin Hubble's 1929 discovery that galaxies are receding from us at speeds proportional to their distances (Hubble's Law), the detection of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation in 1965 by Penzias and Wilson — the relic afterglow of the hot early universe — and the observed abundances of the light elements hydrogen, helium, and lithium, which match the predictions of Big Bang nucleosynthesis.</p>

  <p>The universe's history can be traced from the first fractions of a second after the Big Bang, through the epoch of nucleosynthesis (first few minutes), the recombination era when electrons combined with nuclei to form neutral atoms (about 380,000 years after the Big Bang, releasing the CMB), the cosmic dark ages, the formation of the first stars and galaxies, and the present epoch. A major discovery in 1998 was that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, driven by a mysterious "dark energy" that comprises about 68 percent of the total energy content of the universe. Dark matter, which interacts gravitationally but does not emit or absorb light, constitutes roughly 27 percent. Ordinary baryonic matter, of which everything we can see and touch is composed, is only about 5 percent of the cosmic total.</p>

  <h2>Astronomical Instruments and Methods</h2>

  <p>Astronomy is fundamentally an observational science, and the history of astronomy is intertwined with the development of instruments for collecting and analyzing light and other forms of radiation. Galileo's use of the refracting telescope in 1609 inaugurated the era of telescopic astronomy; Isaac Newton's reflecting telescope design, using a mirror rather than a lens as the primary optical element, became the basis of virtually all large modern telescopes. The opening of the electromagnetic spectrum beyond visible light — radio astronomy, infrared astronomy, X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy — has transformed our view of the universe, revealing phenomena invisible to optical telescopes, from pulsars and quasars to the CMB and gamma-ray bursts.</p>

  <p>Space-based observatories have been transformative: the Hubble Space Telescope has produced iconic deep-field images revealing thousands of galaxies in a tiny patch of sky, while the James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, observes in infrared wavelengths and has imaged galaxies formed within the first few hundred million years of the universe. Spectroscopy — the analysis of light spread out by wavelength — allows astronomers to determine the chemical composition, temperature, velocity, and magnetic field of distant objects. Astrometry, the precise measurement of stellar positions and motions, has been revolutionized by satellite missions such as Hipparcos and Gaia, which have measured the parallaxes and proper motions of over a billion stars. The newest branch of observational astronomy is gravitational wave astronomy, opened by the LIGO and Virgo detectors that first detected the merger of two black holes in 2015.</p>
