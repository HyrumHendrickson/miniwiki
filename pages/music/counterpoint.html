  <p>Counterpoint is the technique of combining two or more independent melodic lines in a musically satisfying way. The term derives from the Latin <em>punctus contra punctum</em> — note against note — reflecting its origins in the practice of adding one or more composed melodies to an existing melody (the <em>cantus firmus</em>). It is one of the central disciplines of Western music theory and composition, governing the construction of polyphonic textures from the earliest medieval organum through the high point of fugal counterpoint in the Baroque era and on into the present. Mastery of counterpoint has been regarded for centuries as the foundation of compositional craft; Mozart, Beethoven, and Brahms all studied it rigorously, and every tradition of formal music education has placed it at the core of the curriculum.</p>

  <p>Counterpoint is intimately related to harmony but distinct from it: while harmonic analysis focuses on the vertical dimension of music — the simultaneous sounding of pitches as chords — counterpoint focuses on the horizontal dimension — the independent melodic trajectories of each voice and the way they interact with each other over time. The great achievement of Western contrapuntal music is the maintenance of linear independence (each voice retaining its own melodic identity and direction) while simultaneously producing satisfying vertical harmonies at each moment and governing the relationship between consonance and dissonance in such a way as to create directed harmonic motion.</p>

  <h2>The Origins of Polyphony</h2>

  <p>Polyphony — the simultaneous sounding of two or more independent melodic lines — developed gradually in Western music from the ninth century onward, beginning with organum, the practice of adding one or more voices to an existing Gregorian chant melody. The earliest organum was simply parallel, with an added voice moving in parallel intervals (perfect fourths, fifths, or octaves) below the chant. By the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the Notre-Dame school of polyphony, centered at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris and associated with the composers Léonin and Pérotin, developed more elaborate forms of organum in which the added voices moved in independent rhythmic patterns above a slow-moving tenor drawn from Gregorian chant, creating complex, soaring polyphonic textures of great expressive power.</p>

  <p>The thirteenth-century motet — a polyphonic vocal composition in which each voice might sing different texts simultaneously — represented a further step in the development of independent voice writing. The fourteenth century, known in music history as the <em>Ars Nova</em> (new art), brought greater rhythmic complexity and melodic independence, with composers such as Guillaume de Machaut demonstrating an extraordinary command of isorhythm (a technique using repeated rhythmic and melodic patterns in the tenor voice) and complex multi-voice writing. The fifteenth century, dominated by Flemish (Franco-Flemish) composers including Johannes Ockeghem, Jacob Obrecht, and Josquin des Prez, saw the culmination of Renaissance polyphony in works of masterful contrapuntal craft — smooth, flowing vocal lines, careful treatment of dissonance, and the first systematic use of imitation (the staggered entry of voices with the same or similar melodic material).</p>

  <h2>Species Counterpoint</h2>

  <p>Species counterpoint is a pedagogical system for teaching the rules and principles of strict counterpoint, formalized by the Austrian composer and theorist Johann Joseph Fux in his landmark treatise <em>Gradus ad Parnassum</em> (Steps to Parnassus, 1725). Fux organized the study of counterpoint into five "species" of increasing rhythmic complexity, each involving the composition of a contrapuntal voice against a given slow-moving cantus firmus (usually in whole notes). First species (note against note): one note in the added voice against each note of the cantus firmus. Second species (two notes against one): the added voice moves in half notes. Third species (four notes against one): quarter notes. Fourth species (syncopated or tied notes): consonant suspensions creating dissonance on the beat, resolving down by step. Fifth species (florid counterpoint): freely combining note values from the previous species.</p>

  <p>The rules of species counterpoint codify practices of Renaissance polyphony, particularly the style of Palestrina (which Fux took as the model of perfect vocal counterpoint). They specify which intervals are consonant (permitted on strong beats) and dissonant (permitted only in specific conditions, such as passing tones and suspensions), how dissonances must be prepared and resolved, how voices must move in relation to each other (parallel perfect intervals — parallel octaves and perfect fifths — are prohibited), and how melodic lines should be shaped (smooth stepwise motion preferred; large leaps handled carefully). Fux's system has remained the basis of counterpoint pedagogy to the present day; Haydn studied it with Fux's treatise, Mozart was trained in it, and it continues to be taught in conservatories worldwide as a foundation for harmonic and polyphonic skill.</p>

  <h2>Imitative Counterpoint and the Fugue</h2>

  <p>Imitative counterpoint is the most sophisticated and prevalent form of polyphonic writing in Western art music. It involves the successive entry of voices (or parts) with the same or closely related melodic material — each voice takes up the theme in turn while the preceding voices continue with new, contrasting material, creating a web of interwoven, interdependent melodic threads. The most highly developed imitative form is the fugue — a compositional procedure (not a fixed form) in which a short, distinctive theme (the subject) is first stated alone in one voice, then imitated by a second voice entering at a different pitch level (usually the dominant, a fifth above or a fourth below), then by a third and fourth voice, while the preceding voices continue with free counterpoint (the countersubject and free voices).</p>

  <p>A fully developed fugue typically proceeds through three broad sections: the exposition (in which all voices enter with the subject), the development or middle section (in which episodes — passages without the subject in any voice, usually based on fragments of the subject or countersubject — alternate with stretto entries in which statements of the subject overlap, often with the voices entering more closely than in the exposition), and the final section (in which a definitive return of the subject often leads to a climactic conclusion). Devices of contrapuntal augmentation (the subject stated in longer note values), diminution (in shorter values), inversion (the subject turned upside down), retrograde (backward), and stretto demonstrate the composer's mastery and the subject's contrapuntal fertility. The fugue has served as the supreme test of contrapuntal mastery from the Baroque to the present.</p>

  <h2>Bach and the Perfection of Counterpoint</h2>

  <p>Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750) is universally regarded as the supreme master of counterpoint, bringing the fugue and other contrapuntal forms to a level of expressive power and technical perfection never surpassed. Bach worked within the German Lutheran tradition, composing for church and court, and his contrapuntal works range from the intimate keyboard inventions and sinfonias (two- and three-voice miniatures composed for his son Wilhelm Friedemann's instruction) to monumental works for organ and for large vocal and orchestral forces. The <em>Well-Tempered Clavier</em> (two books, composed 1722 and c. 1740) — 48 preludes and fugues in all 24 major and minor keys — is the supreme anthology of fugal writing, demonstrating in 48 distinct pieces the limitless variety of character, affect, and technical strategy achievable within the fugal framework.</p>

  <p>Bach's <em>The Art of Fugue</em> (BWV 1080), composed in the last decade of his life and left unfinished at his death, is perhaps the most intellectually ambitious contrapuntal work ever conceived. Based on a single subject of elegant simplicity, it presents a series of fugues and canons of mounting complexity — simple fugues, counter-fugues (in which the subject appears in inversion simultaneously with its original form), double and triple fugues — demonstrating every device of learned counterpoint. The final contrapunctus breaks off mid-phrase, leaving the work incomplete; Bach's son Carl Philipp Emanuel wrote that his father died while composing the quadruple fugue that was to end the work. The <em>Musical Offering</em> (BWV 1079), composed on a theme given to Bach by Frederick the Great of Prussia during Bach's visit to Berlin in 1747, presents a ricercar in six voices and a series of canons of dazzling ingenuity that have fascinated composers and theorists ever since.</p>

  <h2>Counterpoint in Later Music</h2>

  <p>After Bach's death in 1750, the dominant aesthetic shifted toward the homophonic, melody-dominated textures of the Classical style, and strict fugal counterpoint receded from the center of compositional practice. However, counterpoint never disappeared: all the great Classical and Romantic composers maintained a thorough command of it, deploying fugal techniques at moments of formal climax or intellectual density. The finales of Beethoven's string quartets Op. 59 No. 3 and Op. 131, and the Grosse Fuge Op. 133, demonstrate that Beethoven's counterpoint could be as powerful and original as anything in the Baroque. Brahms's use of canon and invertible counterpoint in his symphonies and chamber music reflects his deep study of Bach and Handel. The finale of Mozart's Symphony No. 41 (Jupiter) combines four distinct themes in invertible counterpoint in its climactic coda, a remarkable demonstration of Classical-era contrapuntal mastery.</p>

  <p>The twentieth century brought a revival of interest in counterpoint as a compositional ideal, particularly among composers reacting against the thick chromatic textures of late Romanticism. Paul Hindemith's neo-classical style was explicitly contrapuntal; the Second Viennese School's twelve-tone technique was developed partly to enable rigorous motivic development in an atonal context, and the strict canonic writing of Webern achieved a crystalline polyphonic purity reminiscent of Renaissance masters. In contemporary music, contrapuntal thinking continues to inform composers as diverse as Alfred Schnittke (whose polystylism often exploits contrapuntal collision of styles), Arvo Pärt (whose tintinnabuli style creates a highly original form of two-voice counterpoint), and Steve Reich (whose phasing music creates counterpoint through gradual rhythmic displacement). The study of counterpoint remains at the core of formal music education, recognized as an indispensable foundation for understanding how musical voices relate in time.</p>
