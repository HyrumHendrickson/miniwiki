  <p>Physics is the natural science that studies matter, energy, and the fundamental forces and interactions governing the universe. It is the most fundamental of the natural sciences, providing the conceptual and mathematical framework upon which chemistry, biology, and engineering ultimately rest. From the motion of planets to the behavior of subatomic particles, physics seeks to uncover the universal laws that describe how the world works.</p>

  <p>The history of physics stretches back to ancient Greek philosophers who speculated about the nature of matter and motion, but it became a rigorous quantitative science in the seventeenth century with Galileo Galilei's use of controlled experiments and Isaac Newton's synthesis of terrestrial and celestial mechanics. Over the following centuries, physics expanded to encompass electricity and magnetism, thermodynamics, optics, and ultimately the revolutionary theories of quantum mechanics and general relativity that transformed our understanding of reality at the smallest and largest scales.</p>

  <h2>Classical Mechanics</h2>

  <p>Classical mechanics is the branch of physics that describes the motion of macroscopic objects under the influence of forces. Its foundations were laid by Isaac Newton in his landmark 1687 work <em>Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica</em>, in which he stated three laws of motion that became the cornerstone of physics for more than two centuries. Newton's First Law — the principle of inertia — asserts that a body at rest remains at rest and a body in motion continues moving at constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force. The Second Law defines force as the product of mass and acceleration (F = ma), providing a quantitative bridge between the forces applied to an object and its resulting motion. The Third Law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, explaining phenomena from rocket propulsion to the normal force exerted by a surface on a resting object.</p>

  <p>Beyond Newton's laws, classical mechanics is enriched by the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of linear and angular momentum. These conservation laws, which can be derived from Newton's laws in many cases but which also have deeper roots in the symmetries of space and time (as shown by Emmy Noether in 1918), provide powerful tools for solving problems without detailed knowledge of the forces involved. The concept of energy — kinetic energy (½mv²) and potential energy — allows physicists to analyze everything from pendulums to planetary orbits. Later formulations of classical mechanics by Lagrange and Hamilton recast the theory in elegant mathematical frameworks that proved essential for the development of quantum mechanics. Classical mechanics remains wholly adequate for describing the everyday world of human-scale objects moving at speeds far below the speed of light.</p>

  <h2>Electromagnetism and Light</h2>

  <p>Electromagnetism is the branch of physics that describes the interactions between electrically charged particles and the fields they generate. The experimental foundations were laid in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries by figures including Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who quantified the force between electric charges, and Michael Faraday, who discovered electromagnetic induction — the generation of electric current by a changing magnetic field — and introduced the enormously productive concept of field lines to visualize electric and magnetic fields. Faraday's work showed that electricity and magnetism, previously regarded as distinct phenomena, were deeply linked.</p>

  <p>James Clerk Maxwell achieved the theoretical unification of electricity and magnetism in the 1860s, formulating four equations — now known as Maxwell's equations — that completely describe classical electromagnetic phenomena. A stunning consequence of Maxwell's equations was the prediction of electromagnetic waves propagating at a speed equal to the speed of light, leading Maxwell to conclude that light itself is an electromagnetic wave. This unified the sciences of optics and electromagnetism. Heinrich Hertz confirmed the existence of radio waves in 1887, validating Maxwell's theory. The practical implications of electromagnetism are immeasurable: electric motors, generators, radio and television, telecommunications, lasers, and virtually all modern electronic technology are rooted in the physics Maxwell described. The incompatibility of Maxwell's equations with Galilean relativity would later motivate Einstein's special theory of relativity.</p>

  <h2>Quantum Mechanics</h2>

  <p>Quantum mechanics is the theory that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scale. Its development in the early twentieth century was one of the most radical conceptual revolutions in the history of science. The story begins with Max Planck's 1900 hypothesis that electromagnetic energy is emitted and absorbed in discrete packets called quanta, with energy proportional to frequency (E = hf). Planck introduced this idea reluctantly to resolve the "ultraviolet catastrophe" in blackbody radiation, but it opened the door to an entirely new physics. Albert Einstein applied Planck's quantum idea to explain the photoelectric effect in 1905, proposing that light itself comes in discrete particles (photons) — work for which he received the Nobel Prize.</p>

  <p>Niels Bohr applied quantum ideas to atomic structure in 1913, proposing that electrons occupy discrete energy levels around the nucleus and that transitions between levels produce the spectral lines observed for hydrogen. The modern formulation of quantum mechanics was developed in the 1920s by Heisenberg (matrix mechanics), Schrödinger (wave mechanics), and Dirac (relativistic formulation). Schrödinger's wave equation describes a particle through a wavefunction whose square gives the probability of finding the particle at a given location. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that the position and momentum of a particle cannot both be known to arbitrary precision simultaneously — a fundamental feature of nature, not a limitation of measurement technology. The probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, associated with Max Born, represented a profound departure from classical determinism. Quantum mechanics underlies all of modern chemistry, solid-state physics, semiconductor technology, lasers, and MRI machines, and remains the most precisely tested theory in all of science.</p>

  <h2>The Theory of Relativity</h2>

  <p>Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, published in 1905, resolved the conflict between Newtonian mechanics and Maxwell's electromagnetism by proposing two fundamental postulates: the laws of physics are identical in all inertial reference frames, and the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers regardless of the relative motion of the source and observer. These seemingly simple postulates have profound consequences. Time dilation means that a clock moving relative to an observer ticks more slowly than one at rest. Length contraction means that an object moving relative to an observer appears shorter along its direction of motion. Perhaps most famously, special relativity yields the mass-energy equivalence E = mc², asserting that mass and energy are interconvertible, with the enormous conversion factor c² (the square of the speed of light) explaining why nuclear reactions release such colossal energies.</p>

  <p>General relativity, published in 1915, extended special relativity to include gravitation. Einstein proposed that gravity is not a force in the Newtonian sense but rather a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. Objects in free fall follow geodesics — the straightest possible paths through curved spacetime. General relativity passed its first famous test when the bending of light around the Sun, predicted by Einstein, was confirmed by Arthur Eddington's observations during the 1919 solar eclipse. The theory also predicts the precession of planetary orbits, gravitational time dilation (clocks run slower in stronger gravitational fields), gravitational waves (detected for the first time by LIGO in 2015), black holes, and the expansion of the universe. General relativity is the foundation of modern cosmology and of technologies such as GPS, which must account for relativistic time corrections to maintain accuracy.</p>

  <h2>The Scientific Method in Physics</h2>

  <p>Physics advances through a rigorous cycle of observation, hypothesis formation, theoretical prediction, and experimental test. A physical theory must generate precise, quantitative, falsifiable predictions that can be compared with experiment. A hypothesis that cannot in principle be tested is outside the domain of physics. Controlled experiments, in which all variables but one are held constant, allow physicists to isolate causal relationships. Reproducibility — the requirement that experimental results be confirmed by independent researchers — guards against error and fraud. The use of mathematics is not merely convenient but essential: quantitative theories allow precise predictions far beyond the range of original observations.</p>

  <p>The interplay between theory and experiment in physics is subtle and bidirectional. Sometimes theory races ahead of experiment, as when Einstein predicted gravitational waves decades before the technology to detect them existed. Sometimes experiment reveals phenomena for which no theory is ready, as when the anomalous perihelion precession of Mercury puzzled astronomers for decades before general relativity provided the explanation. Today, physicists continue to push the frontiers of knowledge in areas including particle physics (the Standard Model and its extensions), condensed matter physics, quantum field theory, and the search for a unified theory of quantum mechanics and general relativity. The Large Hadron Collider, neutrino observatories, gravitational wave detectors, and space telescopes represent the experimental frontier where current theories are tested and new phenomena are sought.</p>
