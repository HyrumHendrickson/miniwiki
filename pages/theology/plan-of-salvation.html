  <p>The <strong>Plan of Salvation</strong> — also called the Plan of Happiness or the Plan of Redemption — is the comprehensive Latter-day Saint theological framework that answers the great questions of existence: Where did we come from? Why are we here? Where do we go after this life? It is among the most distinctive and, many find, most satisfying contributions of Latter-day Saint theology to Christian thought, offering an expansive, coherent, and deeply hopeful account of the human condition and human destiny.</p>

  <p>At its center stands the Atonement of Jesus Christ, without which the plan would fail entirely. The plan is, in essence, the story of God's love for his children and his provision of every means necessary for their ultimate exaltation and return to his presence.</p>

  <h2>The Pre-mortal Life</h2>

  <p>Latter-day Saint theology teaches that human beings existed as spirit children of Heavenly Father before birth into mortality — a doctrine with both scriptural support (Jeremiah 1:5; Job 38:4–7; Abraham 3 in the Pearl of Great Price) and rich philosophical implications. In this pre-mortal existence, all human beings developed personalities, capacities, and characters, and exercised agency in choosing to accept Heavenly Father's plan.</p>

  <p>The plan was presented in a great council in heaven. Lucifer proposed an alternative that would have removed human agency and guaranteed salvation for all — a plan that would also have denied the possibility of genuine virtue, growth, and love, since these require the freedom to choose otherwise. The Father's plan, centering on the Atonement that the premortal Christ (Jehovah) agreed to provide, preserved agency and made salvation freely available to all who would choose it. Lucifer rebelled, was cast out with his followers, and became the adversary of God's plan in mortality.</p>

  <h2>Mortality and the Fall</h2>

  <p>Latter-day Saint theology takes an unexpectedly positive view of the Fall of Adam and Eve. The Book of Mormon prophet Lehi teaches: "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25). The Fall was not a catastrophic accident but a necessary step in the plan — the transition from an immortal, paradisiacal state to a mortal one in which agency, experience, suffering, growth, and the joy of redemption become possible.</p>

  <p>Mortality is therefore understood as a period of probation and refinement: an opportunity to gain a physical body (which is itself understood as a blessing and a step toward exaltation), to exercise agency in choosing good or evil, to develop Christlike character through experience and adversity, and to enter into the saving ordinances of the gospel.</p>

  <h2>The Atonement of Jesus Christ</h2>

  <p>The central event of the entire plan is the Atonement of Jesus Christ — his suffering in Gethsemane, his death on the cross, and his resurrection from the dead. Through the Atonement, Christ accomplished several things:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unconditional resurrection:</strong> Every person who has ever lived will be resurrected — restored body and spirit to an immortal state — regardless of their faithfulness. This is a free gift to all mankind.</li>
    <li><strong>Conditional salvation from sin:</strong> Those who repent, are baptized, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and endure faithfully will receive a remission of sins and the blessings of the higher degrees of glory.</li>
    <li><strong>Redemption from suffering:</strong> Christ descended below all things (D&amp;C 88:6) and therefore comprehends all suffering, enabling him to succor, heal, and strengthen those who turn to him.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Spirit World</h2>

  <p>Between death and resurrection, spirits inhabit the spirit world — a realm described in Latter-day Saint scripture as divided between paradise (for the righteous) and spirit prison (for those who did not accept the gospel in mortality). A crucial doctrine of the Restoration is that the gospel is preached in the spirit world to those who never had the opportunity to hear it in life, and that the living can perform saving ordinances vicariously for the dead in temples — the doctrinal basis for the Church's extensive genealogical and temple work.</p>

  <h2>Degrees of Glory</h2>

  <p>The Doctrine and Covenants (Section 76) records a vision received by Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon outlining three degrees or kingdoms of glory that constitute the post-resurrection state:</p>

  <div class="wiki-tabs">
    <div class="wiki-tab-nav">
      <button class="wiki-tab-btn">Celestial Kingdom</button>
      <button class="wiki-tab-btn">Terrestrial Kingdom</button>
      <button class="wiki-tab-btn">Telestial Kingdom</button>
    </div>
    <div class="wiki-tab-panel">
      <p>The highest degree, compared in glory to the sun (D&amp;C 76:70). The celestial kingdom is the dwelling place of those who received the testimony of Jesus, were baptized, received the Holy Ghost, and were faithful to their covenants. The highest degree within the celestial kingdom — exaltation — is reserved for those who received all the saving ordinances, including celestial marriage, and who continued faithful. Exalted beings dwell eternally in the presence of God the Father and Jesus Christ, and continue in eternal progression.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wiki-tab-panel">
      <p>The middle degree, compared in glory to the moon. The terrestrial kingdom receives honorable people who were deceived by the craftiness of men, or who received Christ but were not valiant in their testimony of him. This kingdom is glorious but falls short of the fulness of the Father's presence.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wiki-tab-panel">
      <p>The lowest degree, compared in glory to the stars — which, though individual stars are dim compared to the sun, still exceed the darkness of deep space. The telestial kingdom receives the wicked who rejected the testimony of Jesus and refused the gospel in both mortality and the spirit world. They are eventually redeemed through the suffering of the wicked, but they do not attain the presence of the Father or the Son.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A fourth state — outer darkness — is reserved for the sons of perdition, those who had a perfect knowledge of God and Christ and then willfully and completely denied them. This state is considered exceedingly rare.</p>

  <h2>Theological Significance</h2>

  <p>The Plan of Salvation provides Latter-day Saint theology with a comprehensive theodicy — an answer to the problem of evil and suffering. Pain, loss, and adversity are not meaningless; they are the conditions that make character formation, genuine virtue, and the depth of joy possible. The sorrows of mortality are temporary; the glory that awaits the faithful is eternal. As Paul wrote, "I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us" (Romans 8:18).</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the plan's affirmation of eternal progression — that human beings can grow toward Christlikeness and ultimately receive "all that my Father hath" (D&amp;C 84:38) — is the most exalted anthropology in Christian theology. It takes with full seriousness the biblical language of humans as "partakers of the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4) and "joint-heirs with Christ" (Romans 8:17), not as mere metaphor, but as literal promise.</p>
