  <p>Genetics is the branch of biology concerned with heredity — the transmission of traits from parents to offspring — and with the molecular mechanisms that underlie this transmission. It asks how characteristics are encoded, stored, copied, expressed, and occasionally altered in living organisms. Genetics is one of the central disciplines of modern biology, providing the theoretical and molecular framework for understanding evolution, development, disease, and the diversity of life.</p>

  <p>The science was founded by the Augustinian friar Gregor Mendel, whose carefully controlled breeding experiments with pea plants in the 1860s revealed discrete, quantifiable patterns in inheritance that defied the "blending" theories dominant at the time. Although Mendel's work was published in 1866, it remained largely unknown until its rediscovery in 1900 by three independent biologists — Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns, and Erich von Tschermak — who recognized its profound implications. The subsequent decades saw rapid progress: the identification of chromosomes as the physical carriers of hereditary factors, the development of fruit fly genetics by Thomas Hunt Morgan and his colleagues, and ultimately the identification of DNA as the molecule of heredity by Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty in 1944 and the determination of its double-helical structure by Watson and Crick in 1953.</p>

  <h2>Mendelian Genetics</h2>

  <p>Mendel studied the inheritance of seven discrete traits in the garden pea (<em>Pisum sativum</em>), choosing traits that existed in two clearly distinct forms (e.g., seed color: yellow or green; seed shape: round or wrinkled). By crossing plants and counting offspring over multiple generations, Mendel discovered that traits are transmitted as discrete units (which he called "factors," later renamed "genes"), that each organism carries two copies of each factor (one from each parent), and that in hybrids, one form of a factor (the dominant allele) can mask the expression of the other (the recessive allele). These observations formed the basis of Mendel's Law of Segregation: the two copies of a gene separate (segregate) during gamete formation, and each gamete carries only one copy.</p>

  <p>From crosses involving two traits simultaneously, Mendel derived his Law of Independent Assortment: factors controlling different traits are transmitted independently of one another. This law holds true for genes on different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome; genes that are physically close on the same chromosome tend to be inherited together (linked) and violate independent assortment, a phenomenon later explained by Morgan's work on chromosomal linkage and crossing over. Mendelian genetics provided a quantitative framework capable of predicting offspring ratios — the famous 3:1 ratio in monohybrid crosses, the 9:3:3:1 ratio in dihybrid crosses — that could be verified experimentally, and it established the central paradigm of particulate inheritance that underlies all of modern genetics.</p>

  <h2>DNA: The Molecule of Heredity</h2>

  <p>Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the molecule that stores and transmits genetic information in all cellular life forms. A DNA molecule is a double helix consisting of two antiparallel polynucleotide strands wound around each other. Each strand is a polymer of nucleotides, each comprising a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), or cytosine (C). The two strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary bases (A pairs with T; G pairs with C) — the specificity of base pairing provides the molecular basis for both the faithful replication of DNA and the transcription of its information into RNA. The famous double-helical model was proposed by James Watson and Francis Crick in a landmark 1953 paper in <em>Nature</em>, based critically on X-ray diffraction data collected by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins.</p>

  <p>DNA replication, the process by which cells duplicate their genetic material before division, is carried out by a complex molecular machine centered on the enzyme DNA polymerase. Replication proceeds semiconservatively: each strand of the parent double helix serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand, so that each daughter molecule consists of one original strand and one newly synthesized strand — a mechanism demonstrated by the elegant Meselson-Stahl experiment of 1958. The accuracy of replication is extraordinary: the error rate of DNA polymerase, after proofreading corrections, is approximately one error per billion base pairs copied. Additional repair systems in the cell correct most of the errors that escape polymerase proofreading, ensuring the high fidelity needed for the stable transmission of genetic information across generations.</p>

  <h2>Gene Expression: From DNA to Protein</h2>

  <p>The central dogma of molecular biology, articulated by Francis Crick in 1958, describes the flow of genetic information: DNA is transcribed into RNA, and RNA is translated into protein. Transcription is the process by which the enzyme RNA polymerase uses a DNA template strand to synthesize a complementary strand of messenger RNA (mRNA). In eukaryotes, the primary RNA transcript is processed before export from the nucleus: introns (non-coding sequences) are removed and exons (coding sequences) are spliced together, a 5' cap is added, and a poly-A tail is appended to the 3' end. The processed mRNA is then exported to the cytoplasm, where ribosomes translate its nucleotide sequence into a polypeptide chain according to the genetic code — a set of rules by which triplets of nucleotides (codons) specify particular amino acids.</p>

  <p>Gene expression is tightly regulated, both in timing (which genes are expressed at what point in development or in response to what signals) and in degree (how much of a gene product is made). In prokaryotes, regulation is often achieved through operons — clusters of functionally related genes under the control of a single regulatory region, switched on or off by repressor or activator proteins responding to metabolic signals. In eukaryotes, regulation is more complex and multilayered, involving transcription factors that bind to enhancer and promoter sequences, chromatin remodeling (changes in how tightly DNA is packaged around histone proteins), and post-transcriptional mechanisms including RNA splicing, RNA editing, RNA stability control, and microRNA-mediated silencing. The intricate networks of gene regulation that govern development, differentiation, and cellular responses are a major focus of contemporary molecular biology and genomics.</p>

  <h2>Mutation and Genetic Variation</h2>

  <p>Mutations are heritable changes in the nucleotide sequence of DNA. They arise from errors in DNA replication that escape repair, from exposure to mutagens (chemical agents or radiation that damage DNA), or from the movement of transposable elements (mobile DNA sequences that can insert themselves into new locations in the genome). Mutations range in scale from single base substitutions (point mutations) to insertions and deletions of one or a few bases, to large-scale chromosomal rearrangements involving millions of base pairs. A point mutation that changes the encoded amino acid is called a missense mutation; one that creates a premature stop codon is a nonsense mutation; and one that does not change the amino acid (due to the redundancy of the genetic code) is a synonymous or silent mutation.</p>

  <p>Genetic variation — differences in DNA sequence among individuals in a population — is the raw material upon which natural selection and other evolutionary mechanisms act. The major sources of genetic variation are mutation (which generates new alleles), genetic recombination during meiosis (which shuffles existing alleles into new combinations), and random processes including genetic drift. Population genetics, the mathematical study of allele frequencies in populations, describes how these forces change the genetic composition of populations over time and ultimately drive evolution. Modern genomic techniques — from microarrays to next-generation sequencing — allow researchers to survey genetic variation across entire genomes, enabling genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that link specific genetic variants to disease susceptibility, and population genomic analyses that reconstruct demographic history and patterns of migration.</p>

  <h2>Genetics in Medicine and Society</h2>

  <p>Genetics has profound applications in medicine, agriculture, and society. Genetic diseases arise from inherited mutations that disrupt normal gene function: single-gene (Mendelian) disorders such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Huntington's disease, and phenylketonuria result from mutations in single genes; chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome arise from abnormal chromosome numbers; and complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and schizophrenia involve the interplay of multiple genetic variants with environmental factors. Genetic testing, carrier screening, and prenatal diagnosis allow individuals and families to understand their genetic risks. Gene therapy — the introduction of functional copies of defective genes into a patient's cells — has progressed from concept to clinical reality, with several therapies now approved for conditions including severe combined immunodeficiency, inherited blindness, and spinal muscular atrophy.</p>

  <p>The CRISPR-Cas9 system, adapted from a bacterial immune defense mechanism and developed as a gene-editing tool by Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier (Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 2020), has revolutionized the ability to make precise, targeted edits to the genomes of any organism. CRISPR has accelerated basic research, enabled the creation of better animal models of disease, and opened the door to potentially curative interventions for genetic diseases. Its application to human germline cells — edits that would be heritable — has raised profound ethical questions about the limits of genetic intervention and the social implications of "designer" traits, prompting intense debate among scientists, bioethicists, and policymakers worldwide.</p>
