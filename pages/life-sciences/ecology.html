  <p>Ecology is the branch of biology that studies the relationships between organisms and their environments — the physical, chemical, and biological conditions in which they live, and the interactions among individuals, populations, communities, and ecosystems. The word was coined by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel in 1866 from the Greek <em>oikos</em> (house, household) and <em>logos</em> (study): ecology is literally the study of the household of nature. It is one of the broadest disciplines in science, drawing on evolutionary biology, physiology, behavior, geology, climatology, chemistry, and mathematics to understand the living world at multiple scales of organization.</p>

  <p>Ecology operates at a hierarchy of levels: individual organisms interact with their environment and with other individuals; populations are groups of individuals of the same species inhabiting the same area; communities are assemblages of populations of different species living together; ecosystems include both the biological community and the physical environment; and the biosphere encompasses all life on Earth together with the environments it inhabits. Processes and patterns at each level feed back to other levels: the physiology of individual organisms determines population dynamics; population dynamics shape community structure; community and ecosystem processes regulate the cycling of materials and the flow of energy across the planet.</p>

  <h2>Ecosystems and Energy Flow</h2>

  <p>An ecosystem is a community of living organisms together with the non-living components of their environment — soils, water, air, minerals, and sunlight — interacting as a system. Energy enters most ecosystems through photosynthesis, in which primary producers (plants, algae, cyanobacteria) use solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into organic compounds, storing chemical energy in the process. This energy is then transferred up through the food web as primary consumers (herbivores) eat producers, secondary consumers (carnivores) eat herbivores, and higher-level consumers feed on lower ones. Decomposers — bacteria and fungi — break down dead organic matter, releasing mineral nutrients back into the environment and completing the cycle.</p>

  <p>Energy transfer between trophic levels is inherently inefficient: on average, only about 10 percent of the energy at one trophic level is incorporated into the biomass of the next level (the "10 percent rule"), with the rest lost as heat through metabolic processes. This inefficiency explains why food chains are typically short (rarely more than four or five links) and why the biomass of producers in an ecosystem greatly exceeds that of herbivores, which exceeds that of carnivores. Unlike energy, which flows through ecosystems in one direction and is ultimately dissipated as heat, matter cycles: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and other elements are continuously recycled through biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystem in biogeochemical cycles. Human activities have profoundly disrupted these cycles, most notably by increasing atmospheric CO₂ concentrations through fossil fuel combustion and deforestation, altering the nitrogen cycle through industrial fertilizer production, and accelerating soil erosion and nutrient runoff.</p>

  <h2>Population Ecology</h2>

  <p>Population ecology studies the dynamics of single-species populations — their size, growth, age structure, spatial distribution, and the factors that regulate them. The exponential growth model describes unconstrained population growth, in which population size increases at a constant per-capita rate; such growth occurs when resources are unlimited and predation, disease, and competition are minimal. In reality, populations are limited by the carrying capacity (K) of their environment — the maximum population size that the available resources can sustainably support. The logistic growth model incorporates this limit, predicting that population growth rate slows as population size approaches K and that the population stabilizes at K.</p>

  <p>Populations are regulated by density-dependent factors (whose effects intensify as population density increases) such as food competition, predation, disease, and stress, as well as density-independent factors (such as weather events, fires, and floods) that affect populations regardless of their size. Life history theory examines the trade-offs organisms face in allocating limited energy between growth, maintenance, and reproduction — r-selected species invest in rapid reproduction and produce many offspring with low parental investment, while K-selected species invest heavily in fewer offspring and longer lives. Metapopulation theory, developed by Richard Levins, describes how populations in habitat patches persist through a balance of local extinctions and recolonizations, with important implications for conservation in fragmented landscapes.</p>

  <h2>Community Ecology</h2>

  <p>A community is an assemblage of interacting populations of different species living in the same area. Community ecology investigates the composition and structure of communities and the processes that determine which species coexist, their relative abundances, and how they interact. Species interactions include predation (one species killing and consuming another), competition (two species competing for the same limiting resource), mutualism (both species benefit, as in the mycorrhizal association between plants and fungi), commensalism (one species benefits, the other is unaffected), and parasitism (one species benefits at the expense of another). These interactions can regulate population sizes, influence community composition, and drive evolutionary change through coevolution.</p>

  <p>The concept of the ecological niche — the role a species plays in its community and the range of environmental conditions it requires — is central to understanding community structure. Gause's competitive exclusion principle states that two species with identical niches cannot coexist indefinitely; one will outcompete the other and drive it to local extinction. However, real communities often contain many apparently similar species through niche partitioning — subtle differences in the resources used, times of activity, or microhabitats occupied. Keystone species exert disproportionate effects on community structure relative to their abundance: the removal of a keystone predator, for example, can trigger trophic cascades that dramatically alter the composition of the community. Ecological succession — the directional change in community composition over time following a disturbance — is another fundamental community-level process.</p>

  <h2>Biomes of the World</h2>

  <p>A biome is a major regional community of organisms characterized by a distinctive vegetation type and associated fauna, determined primarily by climate — temperature and precipitation. The principal terrestrial biomes include tropical rainforests (high temperature and rainfall year-round; extraordinary biodiversity), tropical dry forests and savannas (distinct wet and dry seasons), deserts (very low precipitation; specialized drought-adapted organisms), temperate grasslands and shrublands (moderate precipitation; dominated by grasses), temperate deciduous forests (cold winters, warm summers; moderate rainfall), boreal forests or taiga (cold climate; dominated by conifers), and arctic and alpine tundra (extreme cold, short growing season; treeless). Aquatic biomes — the open ocean, coastal zones, coral reefs, kelp forests, rivers, lakes, wetlands, and estuaries — cover the majority of Earth's surface and harbor enormous biological diversity.</p>

  <p>Each biome is characterized not only by its dominant organisms but by its distinctive patterns of energy flow, nutrient cycling, and seasonal dynamics. Coral reefs, for example, are among the most productive and biodiverse ecosystems on Earth despite occurring in nutrient-poor tropical waters — the "desert" of the ocean — because of the extraordinarily efficient cycling of nutrients within the reef community, underpinned by the mutualistic relationship between reef-building corals and their photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts (zooxanthellae). Climate change is already causing range shifts in species and entire biomes, as species track changing temperature and precipitation regimes, with potentially profound consequences for ecosystem function and biodiversity.</p>

  <h2>Conservation Ecology and Biodiversity</h2>

  <p>Conservation ecology applies ecological principles to the protection of biodiversity and the sustainable management of natural resources. Biodiversity — the variety of life at all levels, from genetic diversity within species to species diversity within ecosystems to the diversity of ecosystems across the biosphere — is both intrinsically valuable and practically essential: ecosystems provide services including clean water, air purification, climate regulation, pollination, soil fertility, and many others on which human welfare depends. The current period is often described as the sixth mass extinction, with species extinction rates estimated at 100–1,000 times the background rate and caused primarily by habitat destruction, overexploitation, invasive species, pollution, and climate change.</p>

  <p>Conservation strategies range from the protection of remaining natural habitats through reserves and national parks, to the restoration of degraded ecosystems, to the management of invasive species, to sustainable harvest practices in fisheries and forestry. Island biogeography theory, developed by Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson in the 1960s, provided a quantitative framework for understanding species richness on islands and has been widely applied to habitat fragments, informing the design of nature reserves. More recently, conservation genomics has used molecular tools to assess genetic diversity in populations, identify management units, and guide breeding programs for endangered species. The growing field of landscape ecology examines how the spatial arrangement of habitats across landscapes affects biodiversity and ecosystem processes, informing conservation planning at regional scales.</p>
