  <p>Classical music, in its broadest sense, denotes the tradition of Western art music — the composed, notated music of the European concert and operatic tradition from the medieval period to the present day. In a narrower historical sense, "Classical" refers specifically to the music of the period roughly 1750–1820, dominated by Haydn, Mozart, and the early Beethoven, characterized by formal clarity, balance, and elegance. This article uses the term in its broad sense to survey the historical development of Western art music from its medieval origins through the present, examining the major stylistic periods, forms, and composers that have shaped one of humanity's richest cultural traditions.</p>

  <p>Western art music is distinguished from folk and popular music by its reliance on written notation, its composition by identified individual composers for trained performers, and its cultivation of complex forms and extended structural works. It developed within the institutions of the Christian church, aristocratic courts, and ultimately the bourgeois concert hall, each providing different social contexts and patronage structures that shaped its development. The repertoire of classical music — continuously performed, recorded, and discussed — spans over a millennium, from Gregorian chant to contemporary orchestral premieres, and constitutes one of the most extensively documented and analyzed artistic traditions in history.</p>

  <h2>The Baroque Era</h2>

  <p>The Baroque period in music, spanning roughly 1600–1750, was an era of extraordinary creativity and innovation. It opened with the invention of opera in Florence around 1600, when a group of scholars and musicians known as the Camerata sought to revive the emotional power of ancient Greek drama by setting text to music in a style that closely followed the natural inflections of speech — giving rise to recitative (declamatory singing) and the new genre of opera. Claudio Monteverdi's <em>L'Orfeo</em> (1607) is considered the first operatic masterpiece, establishing the dramatic and musical conventions that would govern the genre for generations. The Baroque also saw the rise of the concerto grosso — a form in which a small group of soloists contrasts with the full orchestra — developed by Corelli and Vivaldi; the latter's <em>The Four Seasons</em> (c. 1720) remains one of the most popular works in the repertoire.</p>

  <p>Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750) represents the culmination of the Baroque, synthesizing the German Lutheran chorale tradition, Italian concerto style, and French dance forms into a body of work of unparalleled contrapuntal mastery and intellectual depth. His <em>Well-Tempered Clavier</em>, two sets of preludes and fugues in all twenty-four major and minor keys, demonstrated the practicality of well-tempered tuning and the inexhaustible expressive range of the fugue. His <em>Mass in B minor</em>, <em>St. Matthew Passion</em>, the six <em>Brandenburg Concertos</em>, the <em>Goldberg Variations</em>, and the Art of Fugue represent the highest achievements of Baroque musical form. George Frideric Handel, Bach's near-contemporary, achieved fame across Europe with his Italian operas and was among the first composers to reach a broad public through large-scale oratorios — works for soloists, chorus, and orchestra on sacred or epic subjects performed in concert rather than staged. His <em>Messiah</em> (1741) has become one of the most performed and beloved choral works in history.</p>

  <h2>The Classical Period</h2>

  <p>The Classical period (c. 1750–1820) is named after the qualities of ancient Greek and Roman art — clarity, proportion, formal balance, and emotional restraint — that its admirers saw reflected in the music of Haydn, Mozart, and the early Beethoven. The period was characterized by a reaction against the complexity and ornamentation of the late Baroque, favoring clearer textures, simpler melodies, and more transparent harmonic structures. It saw the rise and perfection of the symphony (a large-scale orchestral work, typically in four movements), the string quartet (two violins, viola, and cello), and the sonata (for keyboard or a solo instrument with keyboard), all organized around the structural principle of sonata form.</p>

  <p>Franz Joseph Haydn (1732–1809), employed for most of his career by the Esterházy family in Hungary, wrote 104 symphonies, 68 string quartets, and dozens of other works, establishing and refining the major instrumental genres of the period; he is often called the "Father of the Symphony" and the "Father of the String Quartet." Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791), the most prodigious musical genius of the era, composed 41 symphonies, 27 piano concertos, 23 string quartets, 41 symphonies, operas including <em>Le Nozze di Figaro</em>, <em>Don Giovanni</em>, and <em>Die Zauberflöte</em>, and a vast quantity of other music in a career that ended with his death at 35. Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827) bestrode the transition from Classical to Romantic, in his nine symphonies — particularly the groundbreaking Third (Eroica), Fifth, and Ninth (Choral) — expanding the scale, emotional range, and structural ambition of the symphony far beyond anything his predecessors had attempted.</p>

  <h2>The Romantic Era</h2>

  <p>The Romantic period in music, spanning roughly 1820–1900, was defined by an emphasis on individual emotional expression, nationalism, literary and pictorial subject matter, and a dramatic expansion of the orchestra and the scale of musical ambition. Romantic composers sought to transcend the formal constraints of the Classical period, using chromatic harmony, expanded orchestras (adding piccolo, contrabassoon, three or four horns, and later Wagner tubas and other instruments), and programmatic content (music that tells a story or depicts a scene) to achieve effects of unprecedented emotional intensity. Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Frédéric Chopin, and Franz Liszt dominated the first half of the century; the latter half saw the towering presences of Johannes Brahms and Richard Wagner.</p>

  <p>Richard Wagner (1813–1883) revolutionized opera with his concept of the <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em> (total artwork) — the integration of music, drama, poetry, scenery, and staging into a seamless whole. His late operas (the four-opera cycle <em>Der Ring des Nibelungen</em>, <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>, <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, <em>Parsifal</em>) deployed the leitmotif — brief musical themes associated with specific characters, objects, or ideas, woven through the orchestral texture — to create complex, emotionally overwhelming music-dramas of extraordinary scale and ambition. Johannes Brahms (1833–1897), by contrast, maintained formal Classical structures while suffusing them with Romantic warmth and harmonic richness, producing four magnificent symphonies, two piano concertos, a violin concerto, and a vast chamber music output that constitute the conservative pole of the Romantic tradition.</p>

  <h2>The Twentieth Century</h2>

  <p>The twentieth century was an era of pluralism and experimentation in Western art music, as composers reacted against the perceived exhaustion of tonal Romanticism in radically different ways. Arnold Schoenberg's development of atonality and subsequently twelve-tone technique in Vienna in the 1910s and 1920s — followed by his students Alban Berg and Anton Webern — created a new compositional language of great intellectual rigor but limited popular appeal. Béla Bartók, Igor Stravinsky, and Sergei Prokofiev found different paths, incorporating folk music, neo-classical elements, and novel rhythmic and coloristic techniques while maintaining a connection to tonality. Stravinsky's three early ballets for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes — <em>The Firebird</em> (1910), <em>Petrushka</em> (1911), and <em>The Rite of Spring</em> (1913), whose premiere famously provoked a riot — are among the most celebrated orchestral works of the century.</p>

  <p>The post-war period saw the rise of the European avant-garde — Boulez, Stockhausen, Nono, Ligeti — who pursued serialism, aleatoric (chance) techniques, electronic music, and spectral composition. In the United States, minimalism — associated with Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Terry Riley, and La Monte Young — emerged as a counter to European complexity, using slowly evolving repetitive structures to create hypnotic, meditative musical experiences. The late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries have been characterized by stylistic eclecticism: composers freely draw on spectral, minimalist, neo-Romantic, jazz, and world music influences, and the boundaries between classical, popular, and non-Western traditions have become increasingly permeable.</p>

  <h2>Forms and Genres of Western Art Music</h2>

  <p>Western art music encompasses an extraordinary range of forms and genres. Vocal forms include the Mass (a musical setting of the ordinary of the Roman Catholic liturgy), the motet (a polyphonic choral work, sacred or secular), the madrigal (a secular polyphonic vocal work of the Renaissance and early Baroque), the oratorio (a large-scale sacred work for soloists, chorus, and orchestra performed without staging), the cantata (a shorter vocal work, sacred or secular), and opera (a staged music-drama combining singing, acting, orchestra, and often elaborate scenery and costumes). Instrumental forms include the symphony, the concerto (for one or more soloists and orchestra), the sonata (for solo instrument, with or without keyboard accompaniment), the string quartet and other chamber music forms, and the tone poem or symphonic poem (a programmatic orchestral work in one movement).</p>

  <p>The symphony orchestra — the central institution of Western art music performance — has grown from the strings-plus-continuo ensembles of the Baroque to the large modern orchestra of 80–100 players organized in four sections: strings (violins, violas, cellos, double basses), woodwinds (flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons), brass (horns, trumpets, trombones, tuba), and percussion (timpani, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, xylophone, and many others). Opera houses, concert halls, conservatories, and music festivals have provided the institutional infrastructure for the performance and transmission of this tradition, while the recording industry has made the entire historical repertoire available to global audiences. The relationship between the concert tradition's core canonical repertoire — often centered on the Baroque-to-early-twentieth-century period — and living composers seeking to establish new works remains a productive tension in contemporary musical life.</p>
