  <p>Evolution is the process of change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. It is the central unifying theory of biology, providing the framework within which all aspects of life — the diversity of organisms, their structural and molecular similarities, the patterns of the fossil record, the geographic distribution of species, and the biochemical unity of life — are comprehensible. As the geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky famously wrote in 1973, "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution."</p>

  <p>The modern theory of evolution — often called the Modern Synthesis — integrates Charles Darwin's concept of natural selection with Gregor Mendel's genetics, population genetics, molecular biology, paleontology, and systematics into a coherent account of how life on Earth has changed over approximately 3.8 billion years. While Darwin's 1859 <em>On the Origin of Species</em> laid the conceptual foundation by providing a plausible mechanism (natural selection) and a vast body of supporting evidence, the theory has been enormously enriched and refined by subsequent discoveries, above all by molecular biology, which has revealed the DNA-level mechanisms of heredity and variation that underlie evolutionary change.</p>

  <h2>Darwin and Natural Selection</h2>

  <p>Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection was the product of years of careful observation, beginning during his five-year voyage around the world on HMS <em>Beagle</em> (1831–1836). The observations Darwin made — particularly of the diverse finch species of the Galápagos Islands, each adapted to a different food source, and of the geographic variation in mockingbirds and tortoises across those same islands — led him to question the fixity of species and to think deeply about the mechanisms of biological change. He was further inspired by Thomas Robert Malthus's essay on population, which argued that populations tend to grow faster than their resources, leading to competition for survival.</p>

  <p>Darwin's theory of natural selection rests on four observations and two inferences. Observation: organisms produce more offspring than can survive. Observation: there is heritable variation among individuals in a population. Observation: resources are limited. Observation: not all individuals survive and reproduce equally. Inference: individuals with traits that make them better suited to their environment will, on average, survive and reproduce more successfully than others. Inference: over many generations, such advantageous traits will become more common in the population — the population will evolve. This process, operating over millions of generations, can produce the dramatic adaptations and the enormous diversity of life we observe. Darwin presented this argument, supported by extensive evidence from animal breeding, comparative anatomy, paleontology, embryology, and biogeography, in <em>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</em>, published in November 1859.</p>

  <h2>The Mechanisms of Evolution</h2>

  <p>Natural selection is the most powerful and directional mechanism of evolutionary change, but it is not the only one. The modern theory recognizes several mechanisms that alter the genetic composition of populations. Mutation — changes in DNA sequence — is the ultimate source of all new genetic variation, generating new alleles on which selection and other forces act. Gene flow is the movement of alleles between populations through migration and interbreeding; it tends to reduce genetic differences between populations and can introduce new alleles into a population. Genetic drift is the random fluctuation of allele frequencies due to chance events in finite populations; its effects are strongest in small populations, where chance can easily fix or eliminate alleles regardless of their fitness effects. The founder effect and population bottlenecks are special cases of genetic drift with particularly pronounced evolutionary consequences.</p>

  <p>Sexual selection, recognized by Darwin as a distinct form of selection, arises from differential reproductive success linked to competition for mates or to mate choice. It can drive the evolution of traits that reduce survival (such as the elaborate tails of peacocks or the large antlers of deer) but enhance reproductive success. The relative contributions of natural selection, genetic drift, and neutral mutation to molecular evolution have been debated since the 1960s, when Motoo Kimura proposed the neutral theory of molecular evolution, arguing that most evolutionary change at the molecular level is due to the random fixation of selectively neutral mutations rather than positive selection. Today, population genetics and genomics provide tools to distinguish signatures of selection from neutral evolution across the genome.</p>

  <h2>Evidence for Evolution</h2>

  <p>The evidence for evolution is extensive, varied, and mutually reinforcing. The fossil record provides a chronological history of life, documenting the appearance of new forms, the extinction of old ones, and the existence of intermediate forms between major groups. Transitional fossils — such as <em>Archaeopteryx</em> (between non-avian dinosaurs and birds), <em>Tiktaalik</em> (between fish and tetrapods), and the series of hominid fossils recording human evolution — directly demonstrate the gradual transformation of one body plan into another. Radiometric dating allows fossils to be placed in absolute chronological sequence, revealing that more complex forms generally appear later in the geological record.</p>

  <p>Comparative anatomy reveals structural homologies — similar structures in different organisms that reflect common ancestry rather than common function. The forelimb bones of humans, bats, whales, and horses are structurally homologous, built from the same set of bones (humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges) despite serving radically different functions. Vestigial structures — remnants of features that were functional in ancestors but reduced or lost in descendants — such as the human coccyx, the rudimentary hind limbs of some whale species, and the non-functional eyes of cave fish provide additional evidence of descent with modification. Molecular evidence is perhaps the most compelling of all: the genetic code is essentially universal, all life uses DNA and the same basic metabolic machinery, and the degree of molecular similarity between organisms correlates with their evolutionary relatedness as determined independently from morphology and the fossil record.</p>

  <h2>Speciation and the Tree of Life</h2>

  <p>Speciation is the evolutionary process by which new species arise. The biological species concept, proposed by Ernst Mayr, defines a species as a group of organisms that can interbreed with each other and produce fertile offspring, but that are reproductively isolated from other such groups. Speciation most commonly occurs through allopatric speciation: the geographic separation of a population by a barrier (a mountain range, a body of water, or the expansion of a desert) followed by independent divergence of the separated populations due to natural selection, genetic drift, and mutation. Over time, the two populations may accumulate enough genetic and phenotypic differences that they are no longer able or willing to interbreed even if the barrier is removed.</p>

  <p>Sympatric speciation, in which new species arise within the same geographic area without physical isolation, is less common but well-documented, particularly among plants (where polyploidy — the duplication of entire chromosome sets — can create reproductive isolation in a single generation) and in some animal groups. Phylogenetics, the study of evolutionary relationships among organisms, uses molecular sequence data and morphological characters to reconstruct the "tree of life" — the genealogical relationships among all living and extinct species. The advent of genomics and computational phylogenetics has enabled the resolution of many previously contentious evolutionary relationships and has revealed that the traditional five-kingdom classification of life gives way to a more accurate picture of three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.</p>

  <h2>Evolution and Human Origins</h2>

  <p>Humans are primates — members of the order Primates that includes lemurs, monkeys, and apes — and share a common ancestor with chimpanzees and bonobos from which our lineage diverged some 6–7 million years ago in Africa. The hominin fossil record (hominins are the group including modern humans and their extinct relatives after the split from chimpanzees) documents a long history of anatomical evolution: the emergence of upright bipedal locomotion, the progressive enlargement of the brain, the development of tool use and manufacture, the reduction of facial prognathism, and the eventual appearance of Homo sapiens approximately 300,000 years ago in Africa. Key fossil species include <em>Ardipithecus</em>, <em>Australopithecus afarensis</em> (represented by the famous "Lucy" skeleton), <em>Homo habilis</em>, <em>Homo erectus</em>, and the Neanderthals (<em>Homo neanderthalensis</em>), who coexisted with and interbred with modern humans.</p>

  <p>Ancient DNA studies, made possible by advances in sequencing technology, have added a molecular dimension to paleoanthropology. The sequencing of the Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes has revealed that modern non-African humans carry small percentages of Neanderthal DNA (typically 1–4 percent), and that people of Melanesian ancestry carry additional Denisovan sequences, evidence of interbreeding between early modern humans and these archaic relatives during the dispersal of Homo sapiens out of Africa. Evolutionary biology also informs our understanding of human biological diversity, behavior, health, and disease susceptibility. The recognition that all humans share common ancestry and that the differences among human populations are superficial at the genomic level has important implications for medicine, anthropology, and our understanding of human identity.</p>
