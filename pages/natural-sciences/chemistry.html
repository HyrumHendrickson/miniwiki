  <p>Chemistry is the branch of natural science concerned with the composition, structure, properties, and transformations of matter. It occupies a central position among the sciences, bridging physics at the fundamental level and biology, medicine, and materials science at the applied level. Chemists investigate how atoms combine to form molecules, how substances react and rearrange into new substances, and how energy is absorbed or released during these processes.</p>

  <p>The roots of chemistry extend to ancient practices of metallurgy, dyeing, and fermentation, and to the medieval tradition of alchemy that sought, among other things, the transmutation of base metals into gold. The transition to modern chemistry came in the eighteenth century with Antoine Lavoisier's rigorous use of quantitative measurement, his identification of oxygen's role in combustion, and his demolition of the phlogiston theory. Lavoisier's work established mass conservation as a cornerstone principle and set chemistry on its course as a quantitative science.</p>

  <h2>Atomic Theory and the Periodic Table</h2>

  <p>The modern atomic theory of matter begins with John Dalton, who in the early nineteenth century proposed that each chemical element consists of indivisible atoms of characteristic mass, and that chemical reactions are rearrangements of these atoms rather than the creation or destruction of matter. Dalton's theory gave chemists a conceptual framework for understanding stoichiometry — the fixed ratios in which elements combine. Subsequent decades brought the discovery of many new elements and the recognition of patterns in their properties.</p>

  <p>Dmitri Mendeleev's periodic table, first published in 1869, arranged the known elements in order of increasing atomic weight in rows and columns such that elements with similar chemical properties fell in the same vertical group. Mendeleev's genius lay in leaving gaps for elements not yet discovered and predicting their properties with remarkable accuracy; the subsequent discovery of gallium, scandium, and germanium in the following decades exactly as he had predicted was a spectacular validation of the periodic law. The modern periodic table, arranged by atomic number rather than atomic weight, contains 118 confirmed elements and encodes an enormous amount of chemical knowledge in its structure. The periodic trends in atomic radius, ionization energy, electronegativity, and reactivity reflect the underlying electronic structure of atoms, explained by quantum mechanics in the twentieth century.</p>

  <h2>Chemical Bonding</h2>

  <p>Chemical bonding describes the forces that hold atoms together in molecules and extended structures. The two principal types of bonds are ionic bonds, in which electrons are transferred between atoms to create oppositely charged ions that attract each other electrostatically, and covalent bonds, in which atoms share pairs of electrons. Ionic bonding is characteristic of compounds formed between metals and non-metals, such as sodium chloride, while covalent bonding is dominant in organic molecules and in many simple inorganic compounds such as water and carbon dioxide. A third important type, metallic bonding, involves a delocalized "sea" of electrons shared among a lattice of metal cations and is responsible for the characteristic conductivity, malleability, and luster of metals.</p>

  <p>The quantum mechanical description of chemical bonding, developed through valence bond theory and molecular orbital theory, provides a deep account of why atoms form bonds and how the geometry of molecules — as described by VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory — arises from the mutual repulsion of electron pairs. Linus Pauling's concept of electronegativity and his description of resonance structures were crucial advances in understanding polar covalent bonds and the structure of complex molecules. Intermolecular forces — including hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and dipole interactions — though weaker than covalent bonds, profoundly influence physical properties such as boiling point, solubility, and the three-dimensional structure of proteins and DNA.</p>

  <h2>Chemical Reactions and Stoichiometry</h2>

  <p>A chemical reaction transforms one set of substances (reactants) into another set (products) by breaking and forming chemical bonds. Reactions are governed by stoichiometry — the quantitative relationships between amounts of reactants and products, expressed in balanced chemical equations. The conservation of mass requires that the total mass of reactants equal the total mass of products. Reactions can be classified in many ways: synthesis reactions combine simpler substances into more complex ones; decomposition reactions break down compounds; combustion reactions involve the rapid oxidation of a substance with release of energy as heat and light; acid-base reactions transfer protons; and redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions transfer electrons between species.</p>

  <p>Reaction kinetics examines the rates at which reactions occur and the factors that influence them, including temperature, concentration, surface area, and catalysts. Chemical thermodynamics, drawing on the laws of thermodynamics, determines whether a reaction is spontaneous by analyzing the interplay of enthalpy (heat content) and entropy (disorder), encoded in the Gibbs free energy. Equilibrium chemistry describes the state reached in reversible reactions when forward and reverse rates become equal, encapsulated in the equilibrium constant K. Together, kinetics and thermodynamics allow chemists to understand, predict, and control chemical transformations in contexts ranging from industrial synthesis to biological metabolism.</p>

  <h2>Organic Chemistry</h2>

  <p>Organic chemistry is the study of compounds containing carbon, particularly carbon–hydrogen and carbon–carbon bonds. Carbon's ability to form four stable bonds and to concatenate into chains, rings, and complex frameworks of essentially unlimited variety gives rise to the millions of known organic compounds, including all the molecules of life. The field was originally defined by the "vital force" theory, which held that organic compounds could only be produced by living organisms; this notion was definitively refuted in 1828 when Friedrich Wöhler synthesized urea from inorganic starting materials. Modern organic chemistry is built on an understanding of functional groups — specific arrangements of atoms such as hydroxyl (–OH), carbonyl (C=O), and amino (–NH₂) groups that confer characteristic reactivity — and reaction mechanisms that track the flow of electrons through bond-breaking and bond-forming steps.</p>

  <p>Organic synthesis, the art and science of constructing complex molecules from simpler building blocks, has enabled the production of pharmaceuticals, plastics, dyes, fertilizers, and countless other materials that define modern life. The development of retrosynthetic analysis by E.J. Corey in the 1960s systematized the planning of multi-step syntheses and was recognized with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1990. Biochemistry, the chemistry of living systems, is a subdiscipline at the intersection of organic chemistry and biology, concerned with the structures and reactions of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates and their roles in metabolic processes.</p>

  <h2>Chemistry in the Modern World</h2>

  <p>Chemistry drives much of modern technology and addresses many of humanity's greatest challenges. The Haber-Bosch process for the industrial synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen, developed in the early twentieth century, enabled the production of nitrogen-based fertilizers on a massive scale, supporting the agricultural productivity that feeds a global population of over eight billion. The pharmaceutical industry relies on organic chemistry to design and synthesize molecules that interact with biological targets to treat disease. Polymer chemistry has produced materials — from nylon and polyester to Kevlar and photovoltaic polymers — with properties unmatched by natural materials. Green chemistry, an emerging discipline, seeks to redesign chemical processes to minimize waste, reduce the use of hazardous substances, and lower energy consumption.</p>

  <p>Analytical chemistry provides the tools — spectroscopy, chromatography, mass spectrometry, electrochemical methods — used to determine the composition and structure of substances across all fields of science, medicine, environmental monitoring, and industry. Computational chemistry uses quantum mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations to predict molecular properties and reaction pathways, increasingly supplementing and guiding experimental work. As materials science, nanotechnology, and biological engineering converge, chemistry remains at the heart of scientific discovery and technological innovation.</p>
