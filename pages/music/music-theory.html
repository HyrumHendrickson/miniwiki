  <p>Music theory is the study of the practices and principles that govern the construction of music. It encompasses the analysis of how pitch is organized into scales and harmonies, how rhythms and meters structure time, how melodies are constructed and developed, how musical forms organize large-scale structure, and how these elements interact to create musical meaning and expression. Music theory is both descriptive — analyzing how existing music is constructed — and prescriptive — providing rules and guidelines for composition and improvisation.</p>

  <p>The roots of systematic music theory in the Western tradition extend to ancient Greece, where Pythagoras and his followers discovered mathematical relationships between musical intervals — the octave (2:1 frequency ratio), the perfect fifth (3:2), and the perfect fourth (4:3) — and interpreted these relationships as evidence of a deeper mathematical order in the cosmos. Throughout the Middle Ages, Boethius's transmission of ancient Greek theory provided the framework for the study of music as one of the seven liberal arts. The Renaissance and Baroque eras saw the development of functional harmony and figured bass; Jean-Philippe Rameau's <em>Traité de l'harmonie</em> (1722) was the first comprehensive and systematic account of tonal harmony, establishing the theoretical framework that dominated Western music theory for centuries.</p>

  <h2>Pitch, Scales, and Intervals</h2>

  <p>Pitch is the perceived highness or lowness of a sound, determined by the frequency of the sound wave (measured in hertz). In Western tonal music, pitches are organized into a system of twelve equally spaced semitones within the octave (the equal temperament system), each a factor of the twelfth root of 2 (approximately 1.0595) above the previous one. The standard concert pitch fixes A4 (the A above middle C) at 440 Hz. A scale is an ordered sequence of pitches spanning one or more octaves and serving as the tonal material for a piece or passage of music. The most fundamental scales in Western tonal music are the major scale (with the interval pattern whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half, producing a bright, stable character) and the natural minor scale (whole-half-whole-whole-half-whole-whole, producing a darker, more somber character).</p>

  <p>An interval is the distance in pitch between two notes, measured in semitones or in diatonic steps (seconds, thirds, fourths, fifths, sixths, sevenths, octaves) modified by quality (perfect, major, minor, augmented, diminished). The perception of intervals as consonant (stable, restful) or dissonant (unstable, tense) is a foundational aesthetic fact of Western tonal music. Consonant intervals — octaves, perfect fifths and fourths, major and minor thirds and sixths — provide the tonal material for stable harmonies; dissonant intervals — minor seconds, major sevenths, tritones — create tension that drives harmonic motion. Non-Western musical systems use different scale divisions: Indian classical music divides the octave into twenty-two shrutis; Arabic maqam music uses scales with quarter-tone intervals; gamelan music of Java and Bali employs pentatonic scales with irregular interval sizes specific to each instrument ensemble.</p>

  <h2>Harmony and Chord Progressions</h2>

  <p>Harmony refers to the simultaneous sounding of two or more pitches and the way these combinations are organized and sequenced in time. A chord is a set of pitches sounded together; the most fundamental chord type in Western tonal music is the triad, consisting of a root note, a third (three or four semitones above), and a fifth (seven semitones above). Chords are classified by their position in a scale (root, second, third degree, etc.) and by their quality (major, minor, diminished, augmented). The system of functional harmony, developed through the Baroque and Classical periods, assigns functional roles to chords based on their relationship to the tonic (home chord, degree I), subdominant (degree IV), and dominant (degree V), and describes the typical patterns of harmonic motion — the tension-and-resolution dynamics — that underpin Western tonal music from Bach to Brahms to blues.</p>

  <p>The dominant seventh chord (V7) — a dominant triad with an added minor seventh — is the most dynamically active chord in tonal harmony, creating strong tension that resolves compellingly to the tonic. Extended chords (ninth, eleventh, thirteenth chords) add further thirds above the seventh, enriching the harmonic palette; they are characteristic of jazz and late Romantic music. Chromaticism — the use of pitches outside the prevailing scale — adds color and expressive intensity and, taken to extremes, can destabilize the sense of key. The progressive chromaticism of Wagner's late style, exemplified by the opening bars of Tristan und Isolde (1859), with their deliberately ambiguous harmonies, pushed tonal harmony to its limits and prepared the way for the atonality of the early twentieth century, when Schoenberg and others abandoned the tonal center altogether.</p>

  <h2>Rhythm, Meter, and Form</h2>

  <p>Rhythm is the organization of music in time — the patterns of long and short notes, accents, and silences that give music its forward motion. Meter is the regular grouping of beats into measures, defined by a time signature: 4/4 (common time) groups four quarter-note beats per measure, with accents typically falling on beats 1 and 3; 3/4 groups three quarter-note beats, producing the characteristic lilt of the waltz; 6/8 groups two dotted-quarter-note beats each subdivided into three eighths, producing a compound duple feel. Rhythm and meter are distinct: rhythm refers to the actual pattern of note durations, meter to the underlying metrical framework against which rhythm is heard. Syncopation — the placement of accents on normally weak beats or between beats — creates rhythmic interest and is a characteristic feature of jazz, funk, and many popular styles.</p>

  <p>Musical form is the large-scale structural architecture of a piece — how its sections are organized, contrasted, and related. Common formal patterns in Western art music include binary form (AB), ternary form (ABA), rondo (ABACADA…), and theme and variations. Sonata form, which became the dominant large-scale structure of the Classical period, consists of three main sections: the exposition (introducing two contrasting themes in different keys), the development (fragmenting and transforming the themes, moving through various keys), and the recapitulation (restating both themes in the home key). The analysis of musical form — how composers organize their material over time, create tension and release, and achieve a sense of coherence and inevitability — is one of the central activities of music theory.</p>

  <h2>Musical Notation</h2>

  <p>Musical notation is the system of written symbols used to represent music. Western staff notation, the system in widespread use today, evolved gradually over the medieval period. Guido d'Arezzo (c. 991–1050) made crucial contributions: he developed the four-line staff, established the system of hexachords and solmization syllables (ut-re-mi-fa-sol-la, the precursors of do-re-mi), and invented the "Guidonian hand," a mnemonic device for learning to read music. By the Renaissance, the five-line staff had become standard, and the system of clefs (establishing the pitch of a specific line and thereby the pitch of all other lines and spaces), note shapes indicating duration, time signatures, key signatures, and dynamic markings had developed into a flexible and comprehensive notation system.</p>

  <p>Standard Western notation specifies pitch (by the position of note heads on the staff), duration (by note shapes: whole note, half note, quarter note, eighth note, etc.), tempo (by Italian terms such as <em>allegro</em>, <em>andante</em>, <em>presto</em>, or by metronome markings), dynamics (by symbols such as <em>f</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>mf</em>, and crescendo/decrescendo marks), articulation (staccato, legato, accent marks), and expression (through performance directions). Despite its comprehensiveness, staff notation captures only some aspects of musical performance; subtleties of timing, tone color, ornamentation, and expression are left to the performer's discretion and guided by conventions of style and genre. Alternative notation systems have been developed for specific purposes, including tablature for plucked string instruments, percussion notation, and graphic scores used in experimental music.</p>

  <h2>Twentieth-Century Theory</h2>

  <p>The early twentieth century brought a crisis of tonal harmony as composers including Schoenberg, Webern, and Berg pushed chromaticism to its logical extreme, abandoning the tonal center and developing a compositional language in which all twelve pitches of the chromatic scale were treated as equally important (atonality). Schoenberg subsequently developed twelve-tone technique (serialism), in which a "tone row" — a specific ordering of all twelve chromatic pitches — serves as the basis of a composition, ensuring that no pitch predominates as a tonic. Serial technique was extended by Webern and later by Stockhausen, Boulez, and others to organize not only pitch but also rhythm, dynamics, and timbre according to serial principles (total serialism). Heinrich Schenker's analytical theory (developed in the early twentieth century) took the opposite approach, arguing that all tonal masterworks are elaborations of a deep background structure — the Ursatz — through successive levels of hierarchical elaboration, providing a powerful framework for understanding tonal coherence.</p>

  <p>Post-war music theory diversified enormously. Set theory, developed by Allen Forte for the analysis of atonal music, provides a systematic vocabulary for classifying and relating pitch collections. Neo-Riemannian theory, revived in the 1980s and 1990s, analyzes chromatic harmonic progressions using transformational rather than functional categories. The advent of digital audio and computing has enabled music information retrieval — the computational analysis of large musical datasets — and has produced new theoretical tools for studying timbre, texture, and large-scale musical structure. Cognitive music theory examines how listeners perceive and mentally represent music, drawing on music psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science to understand the mental processing underlying musical experience.</p>
