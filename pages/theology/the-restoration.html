  <p>The <strong>Restoration</strong> is the foundational event and doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: the belief that the original Church established by Jesus Christ, with its priesthood authority, ordinances, and doctrines, was lost through apostasy following the death of the Apostles, and that it was restored in its fullness in the early nineteenth century through the prophet Joseph Smith Jr. This event is understood not as the creation of a new religion but as the literal re-establishment of the ancient Church — its authority, covenants, and heavenly direction.</p>

  <p>The Restoration doctrine locates Latter-day Saint Christianity within the broad arc of sacred history: the pattern of God calling prophets, mankind falling away, and God restoring truth through new revelation is seen throughout both testaments of the Bible. The Restoration is the culminating event in this pattern, preparing the world for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.</p>

  <div class="clearfix"></div>

  <h2>The Great Apostasy</h2>

  <p>Latter-day Saint theology teaches that following the deaths of the original Apostles, the Church fell into a state of apostasy — not a complete absence of truth or Christian devotion, but a loss of priesthood authority, correct doctrine, and the organizational structure that Christ had established. The New Testament itself contains warnings of this apostasy. Paul writes to the Thessalonians that the Second Coming would not occur until "a falling away" first came (2 Thessalonians 2:3); he warns the Ephesian elders that "grievous wolves" would arise from among themselves "speaking perverse things" (Acts 20:29–30); and Peter speaks of "false teachers" who would "bring in damnable heresies" (2 Peter 2:1).</p>

  <p>The doctrinal controversies of the early Church centuries — Arianism, Gnosticism, Nestorianism, Donatism — and their resolution through ecumenical councils rather than apostolic revelation are understood by Latter-day Saints as evidence that the authoritative governance of the Church had been disrupted. The great Reformers of the sixteenth century — Luther, Calvin, Zwingli — are credited with recovering important biblical truths and restoring moral seriousness, but they lacked the priesthood authority to restore the original Church in its completeness.</p>

  <h2>The First Vision</h2>

  <p>The Restoration began in the spring of 1820 in a grove of trees near Palmyra, New York, when the fourteen-year-old Joseph Smith, troubled by the competing claims of different denominations and seeking to know which he should join, retired to pray. In answer to his prayer, he reported a vision in which God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him. He was told that none of the existing churches had the fullness of the gospel, and that he would be an instrument in the restoration of Christ's Church.</p>

  <p>This event — known to Latter-day Saints as the First Vision — is among the most carefully documented and deeply significant events in the founding of the faith. Joseph Smith recorded multiple accounts of the vision across his lifetime, each consistent in its essential claims. The First Vision establishes several foundational Latter-day Saint doctrines: that God the Father and Jesus Christ are distinct and embodied persons; that God speaks to prophets in the latter days as he did in ancient times; and that the authority to act in God's name was not currently found on the earth and needed to be restored.</p>

One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other — This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!

  <h2>The Book of Mormon</h2>

  <p>In 1823, Joseph Smith was visited by the angel Moroni, who revealed the location of a record inscribed on gold plates buried in a hill near his home. The record — which Joseph Smith translated by the gift and power of God as the <em>Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ</em> — is an account of ancient peoples in the Americas, their dealings with God, and, most centrally, the visit of the resurrected Jesus Christ to the American continent following his resurrection in Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>The Book of Mormon is understood by Latter-day Saints not as a replacement for the Bible but as a second witness of Jesus Christ, fulfilling the biblical principle that "in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established" (2 Corinthians 13:1). It was published in 1830, the same year the Church was formally organized.</p>

  <p>The subtitle — <em>Another Testament of Jesus Christ</em> — captures the theological purpose of the volume. Its central message, as articulated by Nephi (one of its chief authors), is: "We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins" (2 Nephi 25:26).</p>

  <h2>The Restoration of the Priesthood</h2>

  <p>A central element of the Restoration is the restoration of priesthood authority — the power and authorization to act in God's name in administering the ordinances of salvation. Latter-day Saint theology distinguishes two orders of priesthood:</p>

  <div class="wiki-tabs">
    <div class="wiki-tab-nav">
      <button class="wiki-tab-btn">Aaronic Priesthood</button>
      <button class="wiki-tab-btn">Melchizedek Priesthood</button>
    </div>
    <div class="wiki-tab-panel">
      <p>The lesser, or Aaronic, Priesthood was restored on May 15, 1829, when John the Baptist — appearing as a resurrected being — conferred it upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. This priesthood administers the preparatory gospel, including baptism by immersion for the remission of sins. It is named for Aaron, the brother of Moses, and was the order of the Levitical priesthood in ancient Israel.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wiki-tab-panel">
      <p>The higher, or Melchizedek, Priesthood was restored shortly thereafter by the ancient Apostles Peter, James, and John. This priesthood holds "the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the church" (D&amp;C 107:18) and administers the higher ordinances, including the gift of the Holy Ghost, temple ordinances, and the sealing power that binds families for eternity. It is named after Melchizedek, the great high priest to whom Abraham paid tithes.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Key Doctrines of the Restoration</h2>

  <p>The Restoration brought forth doctrines that distinguish Latter-day Saint theology from Protestant and Catholic Christianity, while remaining firmly within the broader Christian tradition in its confession of Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Godhead:</strong> God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost are three distinct beings, unified in purpose and testimony but not in substance. This differs from the Nicene formulation of the Trinity.</li>
    <li><strong>Eternal progression:</strong> Human beings are the literal spirit children of a Heavenly Father and are capable of growing toward divine perfection through the Atonement of Christ and righteous living.</li>
    <li><strong>Temples and ordinances:</strong> Certain saving ordinances — including baptism for the dead, celestial marriage, and endowments — must be performed in dedicated temples, consistent with ancient practice (cf. 1 Corinthians 15:29).</li>
    <li><strong>Continuing revelation:</strong> God speaks to living prophets and apostles today as he did in ancient times; the canon of scripture is not closed.</li>
    <li><strong>The gathering of Israel:</strong> The literal fulfillment of biblical prophecy involves the gathering of scattered Israel in preparation for the Second Coming of Christ.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Restoration and American History</h2>

  <p>It is not coincidental that the Restoration took place in the United States in the early nineteenth century. Latter-day Saint theology teaches that God raised up the Founding Fathers to establish a constitutional republic under whose protection the Restoration could proceed. The First Amendment's guarantee of religious freedom was a necessary condition for Joseph Smith's ministry. The providential history of the American nation and the providential history of the Restoration are, in this view, intertwined.</p>
