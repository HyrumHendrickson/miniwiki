  <p>Mini Wiki is a personal encyclopedia devoted to the serious study of mathematics, classical history, philosophy, theology, and the broader inheritance of Western civilization. It is not intended to be a neutral compendium of all perspectives equally — it is written from within a tradition: one that regards reason and revelation as complementary, that honors the classical and Christian roots of Western thought, that takes seriously the American experiment in ordered liberty, and that draws on the restored gospel of Jesus Christ as taught by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>

  <p>Articles are written for the curious reader who wants more than a summary — who wants to understand, to trace ideas to their sources, and to see how the great disciplines of human learning illuminate one another.</p>

  <div class="clearfix"></div>

  <h2>Mathematics</h2>

  <p>The mathematical articles on this site emphasize understanding over mere computation. Where possible, ideas are illustrated with interactive Desmos graphs and rendered with full LaTeX notation. The goal is to present mathematics as the ancient Greeks understood it: a discipline of pure reason, beautiful in itself, and indispensable to the natural philosopher.</p>

    </div>

  <h2>Classical History</h2>

  <p>Western civilization traces its political and philosophical inheritance directly to Greece and Rome. Athens bequeathed democracy, philosophy, and drama; Rome gave us law, the republic, and an imperial peace that transmitted Greek learning to the Christian world. These articles treat that legacy as a living possession, not a museum exhibit.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>American History</h2>

  <p>The United States represents the most sustained attempt in human history to build a government on the principles of natural law, consent of the governed, and individual liberty secured by constitutional order. These articles treat the American founding not as mythology but as a serious political achievement — one worth understanding, defending, and transmitting.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Philosophy</h2>

  <p>Philosophy, properly understood, is not merely academic — it is the love of wisdom, the disciplined use of reason in pursuit of truth. These articles draw primarily on the classical and Christian philosophical tradition: Aristotle, Aquinas, the natural law theorists, and their modern inheritors.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Theology</h2>

  <p>These articles approach doctrine seriously and from within belief. They draw primarily on the theology of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — presenting restored-gospel doctrine as a coherent and intellectually serious account of the nature of God, man, and eternity.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="wiki-callout note">
    <div class="wiki-callout-title">A Note on Perspective</div>
    <p>This wiki does not pretend to the false neutrality claimed by institutional encyclopedias. Articles are written from within a tradition that honors the Western inheritance, takes classical and Christian philosophy seriously as intellectual achievements, regards the American constitutional order as a genuine political good, and presents Latter-day Saint doctrine from a position of faith. Readers who disagree with any of these commitments are welcome — honest engagement with a clearly stated position is more useful than studied vagueness.</p>

  <h2>Natural Sciences</h2>

  <p>The natural sciences study the physical world through observation, experiment, and mathematical description. From the motions of the planets to the structure of the atom, these disciplines have given humanity an extraordinary power to understand — and act upon — the creation.</p>

  <h2>Music</h2>

  <p>Music is one of the most universal of human arts — a language that transcends words, a discipline that blends mathematics, emotion, and craft. These articles explore music theory, the Western classical tradition, instruments, folk traditions, and the art of counterpoint.</p>
